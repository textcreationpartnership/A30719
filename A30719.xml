            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

is, that <hi>Learning</hi> is a Jewel of a worth beyond the price of Gold, where the value of it is well underſtood. But alas, ſuch is the fond humourſomneſs of this our Age, that Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is too much neglected, but eſpecially <hi>this ſort of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> wherewith I here preſent you; and though it be a <hi>Jewel,</hi> yet I ſee it may lye long enough in the Field, as it were a common Pebble ſtone, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and many an one, and that eſpecially among the Rich and great Ones, and more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſuch as are conceitedly wiſe, may go by, and ſee, and tread on it; and yet not think

                     <hi>KNown unto God are all his Works, from the beginning of the World,</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>James.</hi>) This <hi>Knowledg of God,</hi> before the <hi>Creation,</hi> was no where written, but in his own Eternal Mind; but after, it was printed in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Book, called <hi>Nature,</hi> wherein, all the <hi>Works of God,</hi> that were to come to paſs in Time, were expreſly written down, as they were to follow in Order. This Book of Nature, was a certain Frame or Model of the <hi>World,</hi> wherein, what by Creation, and Generation, all Perſons, Things, and Actions, were to take their ſeveral courſes and turns, ſo as to come to paſs in time, from the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning unto the Ending of the World. And ſo infinitely and wonderfully Well was this Model of the World con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived; that though the Riſe and Fall of Perſons, Towns, and Countreys, do depend upon the <hi>Virtues</hi> and <hi>Vices</hi> of the Men there inhabiting; and thoſe Virtues and Vices, do depend upon the <hi>Free agency of thoſe Men:</hi> Yet ſuch was the Contrivance, that neither the <hi>Fall</hi> of the <hi>firſt Man,</hi> and the Corruption, and the Cruſh which the World endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

thereupon; nor the infinite Sins of after-Mankind, and the Deſolations that do continually follow thereupon, did neceſſarily require, any correction or amendment, of that firſt Frame. But ſuch was the infinitely to be admired, and never enough to be adored Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt and Providence of God; that at one View, appearing unto him, all the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Turnings and Windings of all mens Wills, and the total Sum and Upſhot of of all Virtue and Vice; He did at once, ſo contrive, that all Fates of Proſperity and Adverſity, of Reward and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhould ſo fall out and come to paſs, as to anſwer the Virtues and Prayers of the Righteous, and the Vices and Villanies of the Wicked, each ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Works, in due and fit ſuiting times.</p>
                  <p>Now the Subſtance of this great and glorious Frame, which the Almighty hath made, is that which we call the <hi>World.</hi> And this World conſiſteth of the <hi>Heavens,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 1.1.</note> and the <hi>Earth.</hi> And the <hi>Form</hi> of it is (as the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> hath deſcribed it) after the manner of <hi>a Wheel;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezek. 1.15, 16.</note> and that ſo as <hi>One Wheel</hi> hath <hi>many Wheels</hi> within the ſame, involved <hi>one within another.</hi> And as the Prophet ſayes, ſo we find it by Mathematical
<pb facs="tcp:101289:9"/>
Demonſtration, that the <hi>Earth</hi> is indeed a round Globe of Sea, and Land, and this Globe is circumſcribed by the <hi>Air,</hi> as within a greater Wheel, which is globous too: and the <hi>Heavens</hi> are, as it were, a great Workmanſhip of <hi>many Wheels,</hi> wrapt up together, one within another; and the Earth, and the Air wrap't up in the innermoſt of them all. Such are the <hi>Subjects</hi> of Nature. The <hi>Forms</hi> informing this Natural Subſtance,<note place="margin">Ezek. 1.10.</note> (as the Prophet alſo deſcribes them) are <hi>four Living Creatures</hi> immeaſurably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with <hi>Wiſdom and Courage, and Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and Strength,</hi> as they are deſcribed unto us Hieroglyphically in the ſhapes of a <hi>Man,</hi> an <hi>Eagle,</hi> a <hi>Lyon,</hi> and an <hi>Oxe,</hi> and all of them with <hi>Wings,</hi> for our bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Underſtanding of the ſame. And that work, which the Prophet aſcribes unto Theſe, ſeems to be the ſame which <hi>Plato</hi> attributed unto the <hi>Soul of the World.</hi> By <hi>Theſe</hi> are <hi>all the Wheels</hi> of Nature put into Motion, and actuated, and hence comes Life, and ſpirit, and power, and virtue into the Heavens; and from the Heavens into the Earth; and from the Earth into Man and Beaſt: ſo as one Wheel moveth another, and all of them do move one within an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; and theſe in and thorow all of
<pb facs="tcp:101289:10"/>
them: and hence come the Magnetical Wonders in Nature, and all Virtues of Sympathy and Antipathy, which work by inviſible concoction of ſucking and expelling. Now beyond and above theſe four <hi>Angels</hi> (as the Prophet ſayes) is <hi>Fire and Light,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ch. 1.22, 26, 27, 28.</note> 
                     <hi>and dreadful Majeſtie of the Father and the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 11.36.</note> 
                     <hi>Of whom, and for whom, and to whom are all things; To whom be glory, and honour, and praiſe for evermore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The great and chief Subjects of this World are <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Men,</hi> the one in Heaven, and the other upon Earth. The Angels are either Good or Bad, and do know their Reward or Doom. But Mens Works are yet upon the Anvil, and Time with them is ſtill going on. Alas, we Mankind are very miſerable by Nature, as we may thank our ſelves for it; but yet is there an happineſs in ſtore for us, may we be ſo wiſe as to lay hold of it: Alas, we are utterly loſt in our ſelves, and no ſtrength re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth either to will or to do ought that is good: Only in Civil Affairs we have a Will to do a little, weak as it is, and free to do evil: But thanks be to our God, who has ſent a Saviour; and with him, Grace, that looſens the Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Will, and puts ſtrength into us,
<pb facs="tcp:101289:10"/>
that we may be able to accept of good things that are offered. He forceth no mans Will, only by Grace infuſes pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and ſo leaves us to chuſe or refuſe; and hence ſome do embrace Life, and others oppoſe. Hence followes Virtue and Vice, and after that Proſperity and Adverſity; Sickneſs and Health; Life and Death, and all the Viciſſitudes of Nature. And though the Accidents Good and Bad, of one mans Life are innumerable; and though the men, who are the Subjects of thoſe Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, in <hi>One Age</hi> are alſo innumerable; and though the ages of men ſince the Creation, are innumerable too, Yet all theſe Accidents which do befal all the men, of all Ages, do come to paſs according to a certain Scheme or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, as God by Nature hath appointed. And in this Method, Men do live by the <hi>Earth,</hi> and the Earth <hi>ſucks,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hoſ. 2.21, 22.</note> and <hi>drawes</hi> all its Virtue from the <hi>Heavens,</hi> and they from the <hi>four Angels,</hi> and they from the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and He receiveth from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and Chriſt from <hi>God the Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now all Mankind have every one of them a certain portion of Wiſdom, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and Wealth, Wherewith they occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in this World, and operate their
<pb facs="tcp:101289:11"/>
Contrivances. And many men do take courage, grow mighty, and purpoſe, as if they would do what they liſt upon Earth: And yet there are two things, we do ſee, overtop the wiſeſt, greateſt, and proudeſt of men in all their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes; and theſe are <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Chance,</hi> two mighty Lords upon Earth, that do ſtrange things. Time, is that <hi>Motion of Space</hi> which proceeded out of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that was before the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, and holdeth on unto Eternity, which is to ſucceed at the Worlds end. And out of this one long Time, are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred infinite ſpaces of Time of great variety of ſorts, And theſe are either general or ſpecial; and both of theſe ſorts are either fortunate or unfortunate Times:<note place="margin">Eccl. 3.1, 2, &amp;c.</note> There is a Time of <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> and another Time of <hi>Pain</hi> and <hi>Grief;</hi> a time to <hi>riſe</hi> and a Time to <hi>fall;</hi> a Time to be <hi>born</hi> and a Time to <hi>dy.</hi> There is a lucky Time of mans life, wherein if he go out to battel, though with but few men,<note place="margin">Chap. 9.11.</note> yet he carrieth the day; and there is another Time wherein, though he go out with forces never ſo great, yet ſhall he be ſo unlucky, as to loſe all that he fights for. So alſo is there a Time when Overtures of Marriage ſhall come luckily, but a mans deſires anſwer not:
<pb facs="tcp:101289:11"/>
and there is a Time when deſires of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage ſhall ſtrongly prompt, but Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures will prove unlucky: but there is a Time too, when deſires and Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſhall ſuit together. And ſo alſo there is a Time when Riches ſhall offer themſelves, whether a man ſleep or wake; and anon again though a man purſue them with wings, yet ſo unlucky a Time occurrs, as ſhall render all his Endeavours fruitleſs. Some men do come into the World in a lucky hour, ſo as whether they be wiſe or fooliſh, yet ſhall they be buoyed up upon the wings of fate, for matter of Wealth or Honour or Pleaſure, in all that they take to: while wiſer and better men, ſmitten by an unlucky Time of Birth, ſhall be as unworthily diſparaged, and in all Purpoſes ſhall be as unhappy. Some ſhall be lucky in the Van of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances, and as unfortunate in the Rear: and others again contrarily. And thus time ſeeems to mock and make ſport with the men of this life, and to ſcoff at all their Skill, and Courage, and Agility, as if they were but meer idle Stories. Now Time of it ſelf is but a <hi>dead thing,</hi> &amp; a meer <hi>Inſtrument;</hi> but the <hi>Wheels of Heaven</hi> turning upon it, do print rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles in its face, and carve and cut out
<pb facs="tcp:101289:12"/>
the various ſhapes of Proſperity and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity upon every ſhred thereof. And pretty it is to obſerve, how a Child, as ſoon as it draws breath, becomes <hi>Time-ſmitten</hi> by the Face of Heaven; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieves an impreſſion from all the parts of Heaven, and the Stars therein, which taking Riſe from the Aſcendent Sun and Moon, and other ſignificant places, does operate as the Impreſſors ſtand in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, nearer or farther off: and this ſeems to be a concatenation of many knots which untie by courſe, and by diſtant turns, and as every knot unties, different times ſeem to fly out, and to do their errands; and of theſe ſometimes you ſhall have two or three or more lucky knots opening together, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles as many bad ones.<note place="margin">Ch. 3.11.</note> 
                     <hi>All Times are beautiful in their ſeaſons,</hi> if men could <hi>hit them;</hi> but by reaſon of Sin, it pleaſes God, that the <hi>world in our hearts blinds our wiſdom,</hi> that we miſs of our deſired Aims, and of Grace to reſt contented in our States.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Great Lord of the World is <hi>Chance.</hi> And theſe Chances are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but the moſt admirable Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities of Nature, which occurring from variety of rare and ſecret opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Heaven, do throw into our
<pb facs="tcp:101289:12"/>
Contrivances many ſtrange Hits, which we could never have imagined to have met with in our own foreſight. And hence there is really no ſuch thing as <hi>Chance</hi> in Nature; Much leſs can there be any thing that comes by chance in reſpect of God. But with us, all thoſe Curious Hits that Heaven ſends, which ſtrike in between the Cauſe and its Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, we call <hi>Chances;</hi> as if things blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hitting in upon us: for ſo they ſeem to us, becauſe of the unfathoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Reaſons thereof. Thus in ſhuffling of a Pack of Cards, or in caſting of the Dice, it ſeems to us a meer Chance, what Caſt ſhall happen uppermoſt, or what Card ſhall be nethermoſt, for a man ſhaking the Dice at all Adventures, and delivering his hand at all Adventures, and the Dice trindling away at all Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, who can ſay with any reaſon what ſide of the ſquare Dice ſhall be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt? And yet it appears plainly by experience, that there is a certain Luck in Nature, that in all theſe Adventures ſecretly guideth both the hand, and the elbow, and the Dice, into ſuch ſteady Caſts as do make a man either win or loſe in a methodical courſe. And ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo it happeneth in caſe of Battel, that Chances do come; and in caſe of Getting
<pb facs="tcp:101289:13"/>
Wealth, Chances do come; and by a ſecret kind of Fate do turn the Scales be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all that reaſonably could have been expected. Now as a man by blowing of coales, raiſeth ſparks of fire that fly upwards, ſo do the Heavens breath into humane actions multitudes of ſuch Chances, that overturn the wiſdom, and Power, and all the greatneſs of man. Theſe Chances are always managed by a certain Luck either good or bad, that drives the nail: and this by ſome Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly influence, that either infuſes ſome ſecret Virtue or Poyſon into the deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed actions, as <hi>Courage</hi> into their hearts on one ſide, or <hi>Diſmay</hi> into their minds on the other ſide, and <hi>Skill</hi> into ſome mens head to hit upon the right courſe to be rich, or <hi>folly</hi> into other mens, whereby they run headlong next way to be beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: or elſe fortunateth or infortunateth by miſtakes of words, ſigns, or acts, that turn to the beſt or worſt, by ſtrange Hits or miſcarriages; and thus many times miſtakes in battel beget an utter Rout, after a victory almoſt made ſure, by meer utterance of a wrong word, or ſteering a wrong courſe. But which way ſoever it happens, the whole mat- is carried on by a good or ill Luck, and the hand of God is at bottom of that
<pb facs="tcp:101289:13"/>
Luck, and that hand of God, is not put to by any new contrived act, but follows on courſe in the motion of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, even as from the beginning it was contrived from all Eternity.</p>
                  <p>Thus both <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Chance</hi> are the Servants of Nature, under whoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands they ſway the World, and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men: yet by her laws are both of them diſpoſed. <hi>Time</hi> meaſures out the extent of mens lives, and ſets bounds how long a man may live by ſtrength of Nature, and how much of that Time ſhall be extenuated by means of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption of Sin; and it alſo carves out Limits unto all particular Fates, as of ſingle life and Marriage, of Bleſſings and Croſſes, of Sickneſs and Health, and all ſuch like matters. And <hi>Chance</hi> acts in obſervance of thoſe Limits, in bringing about the good and bad Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of every Fate. This operates all manner of Surfeits of body, and loſſes in Goods that come to paſs by reaſon of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant manners; and this introduces the power and acts of Nature, in ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drawing, blowing and drive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, alluring and affrighting. For as a man has power by his breath to draw water upwards againſt its Nature tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a narrow Pipe; and by the ſame
<pb facs="tcp:101289:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
breath to blow away ſand or duſt even as the winds do. So the Powers of Heaven alſo: But as they are greater bodies, and endued with greater virtue, ſo can they act their part with infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more curioſity and ſtrength: as for inſtance in the <hi>Magnet</hi>-ſtone: We ſee it has ſuch a virtue, that it can draw Iron, and attract it by a ſucking force, that is ſo very curiouſly lodged within its teeth, that the act thereof is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther imperceptible: Yea more we ſee that this <hi>Stone</hi> has power to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted cate its virtue, ſo as a Knife whetted thereon, has alſo a Magnetical Virtue to draw a Needle, Now the Magnet it ſelf, has all this virtue communica-to it, from the very North point of the Heaven, or ſome Star there ſituate, which ſo affecteth the Needle touched by ſuch a Stone, that where ever it is, though never ſo many degrees diſtant therefrom, and though Rocks and Mountains, and ſome part of the Earths Body interpoſe, Yet this virtue of the North Pole ſucks and draws thorow all, at the utmoſt diſtance, and pulls the Needle point alwayes Northward, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs violence be uſed to the contrary. And thus the Sympathetical Powder has its Virtue from the Heavens; and thus
<pb facs="tcp:101289:14"/>
all manner of Herbs have theirs, and thus all manner of Salves and Plaiſters have their virtue to draw and heal. But as the Heavens can give this Power, ſo have they it in themſelves exceedingly more Curious and Powerful; by which all Chances in Nature do come to paſs. And thus by the ſervice of <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Chance,</hi> Nature operates all her great Intrigues with much Secreſie and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, whether it be upon ſingle or Collective Bodies, and Perſons. It may be thought ſomewhat ſtrange, how Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture brings forth Men and Women at much diſtance of years, hours and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, all deſtinated to die at one time and place, and all of one manner of death, by War, Plague, or Shipwrack; and how <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Chance</hi> do pick them all up, and draw them together by great Curioſities of Fate to partake of the ſame: And yet is it as true as ſtrange, that ſuch things do happen, and that by Curious Acts of <hi>Heaven</hi> and the <hi>Starrs</hi> therein,<note place="margin">Judg. 5.20.</note> which <hi>in their Courſes fought againſt Siſera.</hi> And after the ſame rate on the other ſide, as many men and women by the ſame force and virtue are gathered together to enioy great and good ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>But perhaps will the Reader ſay, How
<pb facs="tcp:101289:15"/>
ſhall theſe things ſtand with the <hi>Free agency of Mans Will?</hi> And he ſayes well, but then withal is he to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; That <hi>God,</hi> who made <hi>Man,</hi> and ordained the <hi>Courſe of Fate,</hi> did certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foreſee and know, the ſeveral and various turnings and windings of every mans will from all Eternity; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all theſe at once in his Eye, did ſo order all manner of Fates as to ſuit and ſtand in with every mans free acts of Will, and to anſwer the utmoſt of his final choice. And though true it is,<note place="margin">1 King. 22.20.</note> God ſaid, <hi>Who will tempt</hi> Ahab <hi>to go to War, and to die at</hi> Ramoth Gilead? as if it had been ſome project upon him for his ſin; corrective to what was ſaid from the beginning; yet it could not be ſo: For God knew afore, that <hi>Ahab</hi> would go, and by what means he would be perſuaded ſo to do, though for ſome reaſon, his way of ſpeech was, as though he did not. And this was uſual with him,<note place="margin">Gen. 18.20, 21.</note> as in the caſe of <hi>the Sin of</hi> Sodom, <hi>I will go down and ſee</hi> (ſaid God) <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be ſo or no.</hi> And yet God Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcient,<note place="margin">Prov. 15.3.</note> whoſe <hi>Eyes are every where,</hi> knew as much, without going down. Without doubt the <hi>Will of Man</hi> in many caſes does make great wreſtling, and much oppoſition, againſt the <hi>Starry</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences,
<pb facs="tcp:101289:15"/>
and prevailes over them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly in many things. And this eſpecially where the Will is fortified by <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>ſtrength of habit,</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over the allurements of Senſe and Appetite; and moſt of all where <hi>Grace</hi> is added, that reſtores Mans Will, unto much of what it loſt by Sin. Now in theſe caſes, the Will of Man prevailes over the attractions and allurements and threatenings of Nature, and all its inſtruments, and turns the edge of Time from evil to good, and repels the force of Chance that it fails of it's effects, and in many caſes lengthens dayes, and receives the direful darts of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ate, either ſhot-free, or elſe eſcapes with ſlight Wounds: and all this while other men, whoſe <hi>Wills</hi> are not thus fortified, do periſh once and again, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the very ſame ſtrokes of Nature, which their Brethren, born under the ſame moments, endured and out-lived with much eaſe. And thus far <hi>Sapiens dominabitur aſtris,</hi> the Wiſe man, above the Fool, may rule his Stars. But we muſt conſider, that in theſe operations of Fate, there are ſome influences ſo mighty, as no power of man can op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; Such as are the fatal <hi>Wounds of Death,</hi> when Natures Glaſs is run out,
<pb facs="tcp:101289:16"/>
and the violent Blows of ſtrong diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of Sickneſs, and the high Tides of Proſperity and Adverſity. And yet in theſe caſes alſo, <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom</hi> have their employments exceedingly worth the while, and infinitely diſtinguiſhing the Saints from Sinners. For the Saint though he muſt die, whether naturally or violently, by Water or by the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, yet ſo prepares himſelf, that he dies with comfort, while the other pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes in anguiſh; he dies a Martyr, while the other periſheth in his Sin. And ſometimes Prayers and Tears in ſuch a caſe have wrought Miracles in ſtop to the courſe of Nature; as in the caſes of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 38. Dan. 3.</note> and of the <hi>Three Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi> And as for great Sickneſſes, the <hi>Wiſe</hi> and <hi>Holy Men,</hi> by Sober and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous life, may extenuate, though not paſs and eſcape them. And though they cannot overturn Proſperities and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities, yet they may cauſe them to work for the beſt, ſo as to do more good than hurt; while Vice ſhall exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate Proſperity, and heighten the Mountains of Adverſity. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, again, <hi>aſtra regunt homines,</hi> the Stars do rule and overpower men. But yet in all theſe caſes, ſuch is the never-enough to be admired Providence of
<pb facs="tcp:101289:16"/>
God, that foreſeeing all <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Wiſe men</hi> in their ſeveral Ages and Times, He hath laid alſo their Fates ſuiting to their actions:<note place="margin">Gen. 37. Ch. 41.40. Pſal. 105.18, 19, 20. 1 Sam. 1.10, 11, &amp;c. unto 20.</note> He foreſaw <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and tears</hi> in his captivity, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly provided and contrived his <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance</hi> in Nature to correſpond there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: He foreſaw <hi>Hannah's</hi> Faſting and ſtrong cryes in Prayer, and laid in her opening Womb, to bud forth in courſe of Nature exactly anſwering thereto. And herein lyes the thing, that while we ſtudy <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> and feel by experience the operations of Grace upon us; It ſhews us ſo plainly the Wonderful Contrivance of God in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that we ſee it with our Eyes, as it were, written in great and plain Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters upon fair Paper, ſaying,<note place="margin">Rom. 11.33, 36.</note>

one Contrivance. So ſayes Gods Word, ſo ſayes our own Experience and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſo Teaches Aſtrology.</p>

                     <hi>[The Wiſe man diſcovereth both Time and Judgment.]</hi> This <hi>Judgment</hi> can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs, than the <hi>Succeſs</hi> good or bad, which out of every natural Affair needs to be underſtood: and the <hi>Time</hi> muſt needs be that Extent of Space, wherein
<pb facs="tcp:101289:18"/>
it ſhall come to paſs. And though there were many ways in thoſe times of <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> to come by this piece of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> yet none of them all, that had either a ſtamp of truly Divine, or honeſt Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Skill upon them, were ever excepted or excluded out of the Queſt of theſe attainments.

<pb facs="tcp:101289:18"/>
                     <hi>Moſes</hi> among the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> among the <hi>Caldeans,</hi> were Men of Skill in this Science; who beſides their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine knowledg, which they had by ſupernatural Inſpiration, and Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, had alſo another ſort of Skill, which by Reading and Study they had gained, wherein by natural Rules they could foreknow Natural Events.<note place="margin">Act. 7.21.</note> For ſuch was the Study in <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi> that was taught in their Schools, and in all lawful Studies in thoſe Schools learned, theſe, <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dan. 1.17, 18, 19, 20.</note> were moſt famous.</p>
                  <p>This Knowledg eſpecially conſiſteth, in diſcerning the Motions of <hi>Natural Times;</hi> and the Curioſities of <hi>Chance and Natural Accidents;</hi> and the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Luck that do manage both of them; and the order of Fate unto which all of them are ſubſervient, together with the moſt curious Acts of Sucking and Attraction, Driving and Expulſion, Alluring and Threatning, Encouraging and Diſheartening, and of all ſuch like acts, moſt ſecretly, and curiouſly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, beyond the ſtrength of imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. And ſuch is the ſum and order of Worldly Wiſdom: and it is conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant either in <hi>Genethliacal, Meteorologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> or <hi>State-Aſtrology.</hi> Of theſe, the
<pb facs="tcp:101289:19"/>
laſt ſort is a piece of Learning that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth much in Conjecture, and is but partly underſtood; and becauſe much of it dependeth upon great Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which beſtride ſome Ages of men between them, wanteth much of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. The ſecond is a crabbed ſort of Learning, that requires much of Time and Study, and yet the Ingenious have gained great Knowledg therein; and miſs but little of a thorow-pac't Skill in the Weather: In which know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg the Learned Dr. <hi>Goad,</hi> doth much excel. But the <hi>Genethliacal,</hi> is the moſt certain Science, and the Maſter-Piece of Aſtrology. Here are many very infallible Rules lodged, whereby many things of great Concern are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly foreſeen. And yet the <hi>Indexes</hi> of this knowledg being many, (as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny out of the <hi>Radical</hi> Figure of a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, many out of a <hi>Revolutional</hi> figure for every new year, ſome things out of <hi>Tranſits</hi> of the Planets, and others to be learned from <hi>Eclipſes,</hi> and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and great <hi>Conjunctions;</hi>) It is very eaſie for an Artiſt to drop into miſtakes, in his general Judgment of a mans par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Fate.<note place="margin">Iſa. 47.13.</note> And beſides all this, at ſome times the moſt Excellent Artiſt ſhall perceive the <hi>good hand of God upon
<pb facs="tcp:101289:19"/>
him, confounding his skill,</hi> as if there were ſome Nativities, and ſome paſſages in a Nativity, which the All-wiſe God is not willing ſhould be known. And to this purpoſe, the Artiſt oftentimes finds himſelf miſtaken in his greateſt Proficiencies; ſometimes by miſreckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his Arithmetick; otherwhiles by a miſcarriage in his Aſtronomical ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and ſometimes great harm falls by a Lapſe of his Pen. And none but the verieſt Fools in Aſtrology will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to perfection. But however fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings or miſtakes ariſe, yet plain is it beyond all controul; That Great is the Excellency of Skill, that lodges in the Noble and Sacred Science of Aſtrology, and contributeth exceedingly to the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding of the Time and the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the Wiſe man may know.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Such is the work of <hi>Worldly</hi> or <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> Wiſdom in the attainment of <hi>Aſtrological</hi> knowledg. But together with this is alſo required the <hi>Heavenly</hi> or <hi>Supernatural</hi> Wiſdom, which maketh the Science <hi>Sacred.</hi> And this conſiſteth in the mingling of <hi>Grace</hi> with the <hi>works of Nature,</hi> as it ſtrikes in, and ſeaſons the operations of our skill, with an holy Wiſdom and Virtue, that renders unto <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Glory,</hi> and communicates
<pb facs="tcp:101289:20"/>
unto <hi>our ſelves</hi> and <hi>Neighbour</hi> the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit thereof. Now this <hi>Heavenly Wiſdom</hi> is ſuch, that without it, all our Natural skill will do us more harm than good. This teacheth us to honour Divinity or <hi>Theology</hi> in the firſt place, and <hi>Aſtrology</hi> in the ſecond, as an handmaid unto the other. And were it not for this Leſſon, our Aſtrological Skill would become rank Poiſon to us; as ſuch a thing that would lead us to the <hi>Devil,</hi> ſooner than to <hi>God,</hi> and draw us into Sorcery, and other evil Arts, whereby we ſhould be entangled with Diabolical familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, e're we are aware, even as are Witches and Conjurers. Theſe work by a way of art quite different from Aſtrology, they having all their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg by inſpiration of evil ſpirits, and it comes eaſily to them; but we have ours from Natural Cauſes and Rules gained by painful obſervation, and hard ſtudy, and it comes not without great diligence and labour. But then here lies the miſchief, that if the Aſtrologer has not the more Grace of God, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying his ſtudies; it comes to paſs, that, either becauſe he cannot by Aſtrology attain unto ſuch <hi>perfection</hi> of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg as his ambition greedily urges him to purſue, or he cannot have it ſo
<pb facs="tcp:101289:20"/>
                     <hi>eaſily</hi> as he would; he leaves Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and falls in with the Devil, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Sorcerer. But Grace teacheth better things: and openeth our Eyes by our Aſtrological Studies, to ſee and adore the infinite <hi>Preſcience,</hi> and <hi>Providence</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> in the laying the frame of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in ſuch an Order, as all things do come to paſs in time ſo ſuitably well, even unto the utmoſt of admiration, that <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>Mans free agency,</hi> do all of them work together in the ſame Subject, ſeemingly contrary one to another, and yet do ſo elegantly comply, by virtue of this Frame of Nature, in ſuch a Wiſe and moſt Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent manner laid, as every one of them has room enough to act its proper work, and that without any thing of hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance, of the one to the other, in the leaſt meaſure. And ſuch is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Uſe of Aſtrology in this matter, as <hi>Divinity</hi> it ſelf, (though undoubtedly the more worthy Science, yet,) cannot give ſuch a plain Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of theſe things, as does the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of <hi>Aſtrological</hi> Operation: For what that teacheth us to <hi>believe,</hi> this maketh us by experience <hi>to ſee</hi> and <hi>know.</hi> Again, it is a great Uſe of ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Aſtrology, to obſerve the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling
<pb facs="tcp:101289:21"/>
Work of God, even in the <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers</hi> very Miſtakes. I remember, that when with moſt greedineſs of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, I did at any time purſue my Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, though with indefatigable pains, yet have I thrown away whole Weeks and Moneths pains to no purpoſe; My whole Operation having been rendred fruitleſs, though tryed upon ſeveral new foundations, and all by reaſon of heedleſs miſtakes in the bottom thereof, lurking imperceptibly, until my finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed work ſhewed the deficiency. And yet at other times, and in other Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, I have found my work to be true and good in two daies ſpace. So as I was conſtrained to confeſs with my ſelf theſe two things: Firſt, That where it pleaſes God to oppoſe, Man labours in vain. So it is with the <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman,</hi> and as much with the <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian:</hi> And therefore no wonder that the <hi>Aſtrologer</hi> errs, when <hi>God confounds him.</hi> And ſecondly, where our Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are moſt vehemently earneſt to know, there it pleaſes God moſtly to oppoſe; Moderation carrying the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, while exceſs breeds diſpleaſure. God Almighty can, and does confound, (many times,<note place="margin">Iſa. 47.13.</note>) the utmoſt skill of the moſt proficient Artiſts of all ſorts, and
<pb facs="tcp:101289:21"/>
thus he did by the <hi>Chaldean Star-gazers.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 47.13.</note> when they failed in their <hi>Prognoſtica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſucceſs of Babylon,</hi> and it proved quite contrary: And thus it pleaſes God to deal by our daies at ſome times: But <hi>Heavenly Wiſdom</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies this diſturbance, and ſets the <hi>Aſtrologer</hi> well to rights. Alſo great is the holy Uſe of <hi>Aſtrology</hi> in demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> how they do in many things prevail againſt the natural Works of Heaven, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce againſt them, and yet without any diſparagement unto thoſe <hi>Heavens</hi> or their <hi>Natural</hi> acts, though they be in a ſenſe vanquiſhed. And laſtly, this <hi>Heavenly Wiſdom</hi> teacheth us <hi>to know our ends, and the number of our dayes,</hi>

Unleſs it were poſſible to underſtand the exact <hi>quantity</hi> and <hi>proportion</hi> of Weather, whether fair or foul, that is like to fall, and to ſay expreſly in what ſpecial <hi>Climate</hi> and <hi>Place</hi> it ſhall begin to fall, it is utterly unpoſſible to pleaſe all people in all places with any predictions of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; For ſhould it be prognoſticated of Rain, and that Rain come, yet if the ſtock of ſhowery drops any whit fail of the due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion expected, and begin to pour down ſome four or five Climates breadth of ſpace ere it arrive at the place of expectation, then will that whole cloud be utterly expended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe Climates where it firſt dropp'd, and a fair day muſt needs ſucceed in the expected ſituation. And thus the Prognoſticator, though never ſo ingenious, for want of ſome drams of perfection in ſome certain predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſhall be whoop'd at by a company of Clowns, as if he were a meer Impoſtor. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the <hi>Winds</hi> are exceeding tickliſh in turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here and there, ſo as who can <hi>perfectly</hi> know them? and yet the failure of the leaſt skill in the turn of the Winds, turns off a glut of Rain or Snow a quite contrary way. And laſtly, (which is not the leaſt of the Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments unto a truer attainment in Meteorolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy) is the want of the Writers encouragement,
<pb facs="tcp:101289:38"/>
either by recompence of reward from the <hi>Company of Stationers,</hi> who are the Sellers of their pains, or of good words from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Buyers, who are the enjoyers of them. On the one ſide, <hi>they</hi> are not ſo much for an elaborate as a cheap Almanack, for one they can get by, rather than to have thanks for: And on the other ſide, <hi>theſe</hi> are ſo ſordid, that never once conſidering the ingenuity of the Author, if they find him but once or twice in a day or two's error of the Weather, he muſt ever be accounted with them for a <hi>common Liar.</hi> So that theſe things conſidered, what encouragement has any man (think we) to ſpend two or three months ſtudy upon writing of the Weather? Whence comes it to paſs, that few write who have skill; and ſecondly, many who have skill, yet write according to their encouragement rather than skill, more ſlightly than warily. But yet, that there is a real skill in <hi>fore-knowledge</hi> of the <hi>Weather,</hi> and of the turning of the <hi>Winds</hi> too, as to gluts of Weather or Wind, and as to the <hi>ſucceſſion</hi> of Weathers; whoſoever ſhall peruſe Mr. <hi>Gad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>'s or <hi>Swallow</hi>'s annual Predictions to that purpoſe, will ſay as much. But beſides, were it ſo, that the Weather could not be any thing near certainly predicted, yet that there is a real skill in it <hi>in part,</hi> almoſt every Shepherd and Husbandman can tell you, who are able to verifie abundance of Aphoriſms of their tried experiences concerning Weather, both by the <hi>riding</hi> of the Clouds, <hi>colour</hi> of the Skies, and <hi>looks</hi> of the Sun, Moon, and Stars. And that they are certainly in the right on't, as to theſe their Experiments, our <hi>Saviour</hi> brings in his <hi>Sacred Teſt,</hi> inſtancing in certain of theſe particulars, <hi>that it is ſo,</hi> as they uſe to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:101289:39"/>
ſay. And now be it ſo, that <hi>Obſervation</hi> and <hi>Experience</hi> can make us <hi>Weather-wiſe,</hi> what ſhall hinder, but that they may ſay as much as to the <hi>fore-knowledge of our own Fates,</hi> if not a great deal more, (there being abundantly more reaſon for certainty in Predictions o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </note> Of this ſort of <hi>Diabolically inſpired</hi> people are ſeveral kinds. 1. There is the <hi>mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Witch,</hi> whoſe damnable ſpleen and envy tormenting himſelf with ſuch a vehement de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of doing miſchief, as he can enjoy no health in his bones; and he not endued with a ſtock of Grace any way ſufficient to quench this fire, the <hi>Devil</hi> knowing his ayld, proffereth his ſervice in this exigent, and the man finding his pain of malice without grace intollerable, eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſenteth, and ſelleth his Soul to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil to gain his will againſt his enemies. Now in this caſe over a wicked man, ſuch as a <hi>Thief,</hi> or <hi>Murderer,</hi> or <hi>Adulterer,</hi> or any man that lieth under any open ſin, and dwelleth in it, the Devil ſeemeth ordinarily to have power over them according to theſe vehement deſires of his Clients, and alſo over every man that <hi>dreadeth</hi> his power, and alſo over every one, of whoſe goods or things he can any ways gain into poſſeſſion. And to this purpoſe it ſeemeth, as if the Devil hath prevailed to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict mens goods, whether living or dead, with divers plagues, as the death or lameneſs of Cattel, and the ſpoiling of proviſions of meat or drink by ſtrange kind of wild annoyances; and alſo to touch the bodies of Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or their Children, by ſickneſs, and lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſtrange kind of fits, and ſometimes by death. But the Devil hath not always this power over wicked men, and ſometimes
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:101289:43"/>
by Gods permiſſion he gaineth to afflict the moſt righteous of men, as he did <hi>Job,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Job 1.2.</note> either in their <hi>Bodies, Children,</hi> or <hi>Goods.</hi> Now to withſtand theſe things is there no way better, than by ſtrong prayer and crying unto God, and by a bold and confident oppoſition of the acts of the Devils, and his Witchcrafts. It is obſerved, that the Devil hath very rarely any power to hurt that Man or Woman, who fears him not: And although it be dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous medling with Geomantick tricks to drive away the Devil, which is as much as to ſay, to drive out <hi>Satan by Satan;</hi> or by ſcratching the Witch, or by burning the Thatch of her houſe, or any ſuch like things, which are abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely doing of evil and unlawful things, that good may come of it, or giving our Souls to the Devil to be rid of the Devil: Yet in lawful things, to violate the Devils act in the name of God, as to burn a bewitched Beaſt with an hot iron in the very act of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched fits, or to thruſt an hot iron into a veſſel of bewitched Liquor, or any ſuch like thing; as it is written, <hi>Reſiſt the Devil,</hi>

Now when the <hi>Devil</hi> cannot compaſs the deſire of his Clients, ſo as to harm the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied perſon, yet feeds he them with promiſes, that it ſhall be done; and thus keeps he them in vain expectations, until he puts a period to them.</p>

The <hi>merry Witches</hi> are commonly called <hi>White Witches,</hi> who uſually drive a trade of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching, whom the malitious or covetous have harmed. And this plauſible ſort of white Witches, while they pretend to do nothing but good, do the greateſt hurt. For while people think, or ſeem at leaſt, to think no harm, here are they drawn in to make uſe of the Devil to drive away the Devil, and the good they ſeem to receive by theſe men, never does them good; for whether they be ſtoln goods brought again by this means, they ſhall not doubt being recovered, or the perſon

It is very ſtrange, which is credibly reported, how theſe White Witches do oftentimes force the Thief to bring back the ſtoln goods, and to caſt them down where they had them; but goods ſo returned upon ſuch a ſcore, certainly ſhall never profit them, who procured their return after this manner; for it is moſt certain, that this can be done no other way but by the Devil, or by a cheat; and if credible perſons may be believed, ſuch things have been acted, paſt all colour of cheats. But, will ſome ſay, ſeeing the Devil is for certain the greateſt Liar in nature, how can he tell theſe men truth? or if he tell them never ſo true, how can they believe ſo great a Liar? In anſwer to this we muſt note, that the Devil does ſometimes tell true, becauſe he cannot do otherwiſe; as when he was forced to confeſs,<note place="margin">Luke 4.41.</note> that <hi>Chriſt was the Son of God;</hi> and ſometimes he tells true for his own advantage, in order that men may be drawn to believe his lies with the greater affection and zeal: Thus does he tell true unto his Clients, to oblige them to be ſo much the firmer his; and in order, that in the end he may ſwallow them up in his deluſions. But whether he tell true or falſe, they who are his, are ſo bewitched by him, as to believe it to be true, whether it be right, or never ſo much wrong.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe <hi>ſpaces of Meaſure</hi> are chiefly bounded by the <hi>Equinoctial Line,</hi> and the two <hi>Polar Points.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Equinoctial Line</hi> is a great Circle, which we imagine to compaſs the whole World of Heaven and Earth in that <hi>ſpace</hi> [extending from the Orb of the Moon unto the Emperial Heaven) where the Days and Nights are of equal length all the whole year about.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Polar Points</hi> are thoſe two Points in the immenſe Ball of the World which are equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtant from the Equinoctial Line; the one in the utmoſt Northern, and the other in the utmoſt Southern point.</p>
                     <p>Now this Equinoctial Line is conceived to be preciſely 360 Degrees in its whole circuit, or divided into ſo many equal parts of ſpace; and every one of thoſe Degrees is divided into the ſpace of 60 Minutes, or 60 ſeveral parts of a Degree; and every Minute into as many Seconds.</p>
                     <p>And as the <hi>Equinoctial</hi> is, ſo is the <hi>Meridian</hi> conceived to be the ſpace of 360 Degrees. This is another great Circle, extending from the one Polar Point unto the other, and twice cutting the Equinoctial Line, compaſſeth the whole World from North to South, as the Equinoctial doth from Eaſt to Weſt, and ſo returneth unto the ſame Point where it firſt began. But whereas the Equinoctial Line is a certain ſpace <hi>immutable,</hi> the Meridian Line is not ſo, but is <hi>immutable,</hi> and circleth the World in any or all Degrees of the Equator, even as we pleaſe to conceive or imagine.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="60" facs="tcp:101289:52"/>The 360 Degrees of the Equinoctial Line are called the <hi>Longitude of the World,</hi> becauſe they are in order as the Sun and all the Stars do move along in their Circuits round abount the ſpacious Heavens in their ſeveral Orbs. But the 360 Degrees of the Meridian are called the <hi>Latitude of the World,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they mete out that diſtance, wherein the Sun and all the Stars, in a due and certain breadth one from another, do move in their Circuits from Eaſt to Weſt.</p>
                     <p>The Sun in his Circuit keepeth not the Equinoctial Line, but <hi>declineth</hi> one part of the year unto the Northwards, and another part of the year unto the Southwards: And all the other Planets obſerving the ſame or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, (excepting that whereas the Sun keepeth to a conſtant and level track, theſe vary ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more and ſometimes leſs diſtant from the Equinoctial Line, than is this track of the Suns.) Hence occaſioneth another great Circle to be imagined in the Heavens, called the <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diack:</hi> This <hi>Zodiack</hi> being alſo 360 Degrees in the whole Circuit, is conceived to be about 16 Degrees in breadth; for that the Planets having ſometimes (ſome of them at leaſt) 8 Degrees and odd Minutes in North Latitude from the Suns courſe, and ſometimes as much in South-Latitude; this <hi>Zodiack,</hi> which is, as it were, the high road-way of the Planets in their Perigrination about the World, is eſteemed to be of ſo much breadth, as the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets any of them do ſwerve in their Latitude to the North or South: And the <hi>Suns path<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> in the midſt thereof is called the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> Line.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Zodiack</hi> is divided into twelve equal parts, called the <hi>Twelve Signs;</hi> and theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:101289:52"/>
where the Sun entreth the Equinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to the Northwards, the firſt Sign is called <hi>Aries,</hi> and the reſt in order are called <hi>Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gittarius, Capricornus, Aquarius,</hi> and <hi>Piſces.</hi> Theſe Signs are divided all of them into 30 equal parts, called <hi>Degrees;</hi> and theſe Degrees are all of them ſubdivided into 60 equal parts, called <hi>Minutes,</hi> and they again are ſubdivided every one of them into 60 <hi>Seconds,</hi> and they again into <hi>Thirds.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now when the Sun entreth into the Sign called <hi>Cancer,</hi> then is he in his greateſt <hi>North Declination,</hi> and at that time is diſtant from the Equinoctial Line 23 Degrees to the North; whence occaſioneth the Circle called the <hi>Tropick of Cancer,</hi> the Centre of which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>North-Pole,</hi> it compaſſeth ſo much of the Call of the round World, as falls under 23 Degrees and above an half from the Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to the Northwards. And where the Sun entreth the Sign called <hi>Capricornus,</hi> he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his greateſt South Declination, and thence occaſioneth another Circle to be imagined, called the <hi>Tropick of Capricorn,</hi> as many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees diſtant from the Equator to the South. Forty five Degrees diſtant from each Tropical Circle are two Circles more, uſually imagined, called the <hi>Artick</hi> and <hi>Antartick</hi> Circles, which being but little above 20 Degrees diſtant from each Pole, do alſo compaſs ſome little portion of the skirt of the world. And inferiour to theſe are other Circles, called <hi>Parallels,</hi> which running from Eaſt to Weſt, ſo divide the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens into ſeveral ſpaces between the greater Circles.</p>

And as it doth appear by very good experiments, according to theſe ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Heavens do produce very various qualities. This <hi>motion</hi> of Heaven is ordinarily divided into twelve equal parts or proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, called the <hi>Twelve Houſes of Heaven;</hi> and as it further appears by experience, theſe <hi>Houſes</hi> are the great <hi>Wheel of Nature,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on do depend the various fortunes contingent to all ſublunary matters and things. Theſe <hi>twelve Houſes</hi> are either <hi>Angular, Succedent,</hi> or <hi>Cadent.</hi> The <hi>Angular Houſes</hi> are four, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Aſcendent, Mid-heaven,</hi> the <hi>Seventh Houſe,</hi> and the <hi>bottom of Heaven.</hi> The <hi>Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> is that part of Heaven which is always riſing up level with our <hi>Horiſon,</hi> the very <hi>point aſcending</hi> is the Cuſp or principal Seat of this Houſe,<note place="margin">Of the twelve Houſes of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and their qualities by accident. And firſt, of the Aſcendent and its qualities.</note> and extendeth about ſome 5 Degrees above the Earth, and 25 immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſucceeding, ready to aſcend. But if Signs of <hi>long Aſcenſion</hi> do aſcend, halfe 5 Degrees above the Earth, are all that this Houſe can claim, and ſome 13 below are its utmoſt ſhare. And
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:101289:56"/>
yet if Signs of ſhort <hi>Aſcenſions</hi> do Aſcend, it may well be afforded twice 5 degrees above ground, and 50 below. The <hi>quality</hi> of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever part of Heaven that taketh up the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of this Houſe, is to carry along with it the <hi>health</hi> and <hi>life</hi> of every Native and thing, that is conceived or brought forth within its juriſdiction. And hence hath this point of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a faculty of attracting or receiving the vertues of the <hi>Heavenly matter</hi> that is acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally tranſiting that part of Heaven at Birth, and alſo of the <hi>Planets</hi> and <hi>fixed Stars</hi> in their <hi>Tranſits,</hi> and of all the rays of the Planets in their <hi>Aſpects</hi> into this part of Heaven, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the forming of the ſhape, ſtature, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of the body, quality of the mind, and of all accidents and contingencies which ſhall befall the Natives body, or health, or life, unto his dying day. Such a ſympathy it ſeems there is between this part of the heavenly frame, and of every <hi>act</hi> and <hi>thing</hi> that is hatch'd, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives life under it. For as the ſeed in the ground, after it hath firſt put forth root, buds forth and appears above-ground; ſo the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, after they have framed the <hi>Embryon,</hi> and the <hi>Temperament</hi> thereof, under the Earth, give it life and being of its own, putting forth level with them as they juſt aſcend. For we do not ſuppoſe as if the <hi>temperature</hi> and <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities</hi> of the Native were framed wholly at the exact time of Birth, although the ſituation of Heaven at that time never fails exactly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe them. No, theſe <hi>temperatures</hi> and <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities</hi> are formed in the womb, from the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,</hi> but yet the <hi>Birth</hi> deſcribes them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that Birth cannot fall at any moment af time, but even with <hi>that part</hi> of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly matter aſcending, which is interreſſed
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:101289:57"/>

And now is it farther obſerved, that that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar place of Heaven when the Moon cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this Line, is very much affected with this her motion. The Moon is the <hi>great Lady of Life and Growth,</hi> and whed ſhe cutteth this Line therefore to the <hi>Northwards,</hi> (which is to come nearer into this Northern World) then leaves ſhe behind her an extraordinary meaſure of fruitfulneſs upon that point of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſo that (like unto <hi>rich Compoſt,</hi> which whether it be laid upon Graſs or Corn, makes it exceedingly to grow the better, ſo) it won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully fructifies with its influence all things whatſoever happening within the line of its

But now when the <hi>Moon</hi> cutteth the Line to go from us to the Southwards, then leaveth ſhe that point of Heaven where this interſection was made, as <hi>barren</hi> to all intents and purpoſes as the other was fruitful. Hence this Point aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding blemiſhes <hi>Life,</hi> and leaves a ſtain upon it, empaireth <hi>Honour</hi> in <hi>Mid-heaven,</hi> and waſtes <hi>Riches</hi> when it happens in the <hi>Eleventh:</hi> It weakens as well the good natures of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> as the ill natures of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars.</hi> But now beyond the Equinoctial our experience is ſilent, yet ſuppoſe we, that the <hi>Dragons Tail</hi> is the fruitful point, and the <hi>Head</hi> the barren point, for that the Moon <hi>going off</hi> from us, is coming on with them.</p>

Some of them have palpable and ſenſible Influences, beſides their ſecret operations; but others have onely their ſecret Powers. Thus the <hi>Sun</hi> very ſenſibly operates in heat and life, and ſo does the <hi>Moon,</hi> but not ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently; but <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> and the reſt act imperceptibly. 3. Some of them are <hi>bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent</hi> in their ſecret Influences, and others <hi>malevolent,</hi> and a third ſort act indifferently. Thus <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> are wholly <hi>benevolent, Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> are altogether <hi>malevolent, Sol, Luna,</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> are <hi>indifferent,</hi> that is, they are <hi>benevolent</hi> when well dignified, or when joyned with fortunate Planets, and <hi>male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent</hi> when ill dignified, or joyned with evil Planets. As to their <hi>ſituation</hi> and <hi>motion</hi> it is apparent, that about the <hi>Earth</hi> the <hi>Moon</hi> it ſelf makes a Circle once in every 27 days and odd hours; and about the <hi>Sun, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> makes his Circle once in every 88 days;
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:101289:63"/>
and <hi>Venus</hi> about <hi>Mercury</hi> and the <hi>Sun</hi> once in every 225 days. But whether the <hi>Sun</hi> or the <hi>Earth</hi> be the <hi>Centre of the World,</hi> and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence whether the <hi>Earth</hi> circleth the <hi>Sun,</hi> or the <hi>Sun</hi> the <hi>Earth,</hi> is not generally agreed yet amongſt Aſtronomers. The firſt opinion of late years hath gained the greateſt number of learned Votes, and ſeems to make the moſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of the Heavens. But chuſe whether way you pleaſe, Aſtrology is no way concerned which way the Conqueſt leads; but whether the <hi>Sun</hi> or the <hi>Earth</hi> be Centre of the World, the Planet <hi>Mars</hi> circleth all, both <hi>Sun, Mercury,</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> as well as <hi>Luna</hi> and the <hi>Earth,</hi> and this he does once in almoſt every two years. The Planet <hi>Jupiter</hi> circleth <hi>Mars,</hi> and all the reſt; but in regard of the great compaſs he fetches in order to perform his circuit, it is almoſt eleven years before he can accompliſh his rounds. Yet the Planet <hi>Saturn</hi> circleth this <hi>Jupiter</hi> and all the reſt; but in regard of a far greater compaſs his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney does require, it is almoſt 30 years ere he can come about. Hence <hi>Saturn, Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> are called the <hi>Superiour Planets,</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Mercury,</hi> and <hi>Luna</hi> the <hi>Inferiour;</hi> and again, they the <hi>ſlow</hi> Planets, and theſe the <hi>ſwift.</hi> And yet not but that <hi>Saturn</hi> may move as nimbly as the <hi>Moon,</hi> onely becauſe of his vaſt and ſpacious circuit he runs, he ſeems to us at this great diſtance from him to be ſlow, and thence is called, and eſteemed as he ſeems, rather than indeed he is. Now by means of theſe Circuits about the Earth, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the ſeeming <hi>Retrogradations</hi> of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets. <hi>Mercury</hi> at every turn he gets beyond the <hi>Sun</hi> from us, in his wheeling about him, ſeems to <hi>return</hi> by retrograde motion until he
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:101289:64"/>
is quite on this ſide the Sun; and hence he is ſaid to be retrograde four times in every year. <hi>Venus</hi> in her rounds gets beyond the Sun but once in leſs than a year, and therefore is no oftner retrograde. <hi>Mars</hi> and the <hi>Sun,</hi> or the <hi>Earth,</hi> differing not ſo much in their motion, it's not above once in almoſt two years time, that any thing can be made appear between him and the Earth of any kind of retrogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.

The <hi>Qualities</hi> of the Planets are to be conſidered either in their <hi>Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> or <hi>Aſpects.</hi> The <hi>Conjunction</hi> of a Planet is that, whereby it is bodily preſent, and acting upon any <hi>Subject</hi> or <hi>Thing,</hi> even as when a Hen ſitteth hurking over her Eggs or Chickens. Theſe Conjunctions happen, either when one Planet joyneth with another, or of what time any Planet cometh into any concerned part of Heaven, as into the Degree aſcending or culminating, as it was at the point of any mans Birth, or Marriage, or any other conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable time. In this caſe, all the Planets have their ſecret virtues and power of operation, even as a Plaiſter bodily applied to any part of a mans body, hath its power of attraction or corroboration. To this purpoſe the <hi>Sun</hi> hath his ſecret Qualities, and produceth <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects hot</hi> and <hi>dry</hi> for matter of temper, and worketh qualities <hi>Heroick, Noble, Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,</hi> and <hi>Majeſtick</hi> for matter of humour: and this does he when he is under ground, and out of ſight, as well as when he is above-ground, and in his full ſhine and luſtre.

                        <hi>dry,</hi> and worketh humours <hi>bold, fierce, violent,</hi> and <hi>couragious.</hi> But yet however theſe two may ſeem thus nearly of kin, there is a vaſt difference in diſpoſition between them; for the <hi>Sun</hi> is a great and true friend of <hi>Natures,</hi> and therefore however he may be hot and burning by Nature, yet is he like the fire in the <hi>Buſh of Moſes,</hi> which <hi>burned</hi> and yet <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed not.</hi> But <hi>Mars</hi> more like the <hi>evil one</hi> of an <hi>envious eye,</hi> where-ever he penetrates, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth his operations with a malignant and conſuming heat, which bites like the <hi>worm that never dies,</hi> and that with a kind of glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heat, that ſcorches though it never flames. He it is who worketh all manner of Fevers, and other violent and hot diſtempers in the vitals and intrals of living bodies; and all manner of falls, blows, and wounds of the body, that come by violence, by reaſon of iron, wood, or ſtone; and theſe miſchiefs he purſues with ſuch imbitter'd venome, that occaſions the ranckling and feſtering of wounds, and that ſo, as, without a curb to his fury, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becomes inevitably fatal; and yet all this while, not the leaſt ſenſible heat ſhall be once felt outwardly. Theſe kind of miſchiefs are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo wrought by the <hi>Sun;</hi> but then firſt, it is not <hi>naturally</hi> ſo, but by accident, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Suns operation being corrupted by the croſs Rays of ſome malignant Planet, or part of Heaven. And 2. when it is ſo, there is not that venom in thoſe diſtempers occaſioned by the body of the Sun as in thoſe of <hi>Mars.</hi> The great work of <hi>Mars</hi> is, to endue a Native with courage and reſolution, and to fit for War; but then withall he naturally breeds quarrels by raſh actions, and ſo cuts out work and way for War. The <hi>Sun</hi> endues with more

                     <p>The <hi>Moons</hi> operations for matter of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per are <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>moiſt,</hi> and for matter of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, <hi>fickle,</hi> and <hi>loving novelties, ſoft</hi> and <hi>tender,</hi> and yet <hi>ſtudious.</hi> Much of the ſame nature with the <hi>Moon</hi> is the Planet <hi>Venus,</hi> onely with this difference, that whereas the <hi>Moon</hi> is <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>moiſt, Venus</hi> is rather <hi>cool</hi> and <hi>moiſt;</hi> and whereas the <hi>Moon</hi> is but indifferently affected to befriend or envy, <hi>Venus</hi> is altogether friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to her utmoſt power. But in operation of humours, <hi>Venus</hi> ſtirs up exceedingly unto all manner of delights and pleaſures, as unto <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, Play, Merriment, Marriage,</hi> and all kind of ſuch like matters.

                        <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> are the great Nurſes of Nature, but the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> are as it were the <hi>Parents</hi> of it, who like Man and Wife, by ſecret Coitions in their Conjunction and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Aſpects, bring forth the whole life and growth of all the World, both in Vegetive, Senſitive, and Intellectual creatures.

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:101289:65"/>
whit avail. Now the <hi>Moon,</hi> notwithſtanding her quickning faculty, yet is ſo exceeding moiſt and cold, that many times ſhe too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten kills Natures off-ſpring. But where Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has any good degree of ſtrength, ſhe mingles <hi>life</hi> in ſuch a manner with her cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that Natives grow up by her virtue as cold as 'tis, as the Wheat and Rie, which live through Froſt and Snow.</p>
                     <p>The Planets, <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what near of the ſame nature, both of them being cold and dry; onely here is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, <hi>Mercury</hi> operates cold as <hi>Earth,</hi> and <hi>Saturn</hi> as <hi>Ice.</hi> Alſo <hi>Mercury</hi> is indifferently affected unto Nature, but <hi>Saturn</hi> ſeems an <hi>utter enemy.</hi> The great power of <hi>Mercury</hi> is chiefly acted upon the <hi>Brain,</hi> which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doweth with wit, more or leſs, according to his ſtrength: and by vertue of his influence upon the Brain and Nerves, he cauſeth <hi>agility</hi> of body, and is generally the Patron Star of <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> and all manner of <hi>Learned men,</hi> and of <hi>Travellers,</hi> and all manner of <hi>travelling men;</hi> and when he is but poorly dignified, of <hi>Thieves</hi> and <hi>Cheats,</hi> and all manner of <hi>abuſed Wits;</hi> and ſometimes, in a weak Nativity, his body produceth diſeaſes of the Brain, as mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, liſping, dumbneſs, and ſuch like; and this eſpecially when he is Lord of the <hi>Eighth</hi> or <hi>Sixth</hi> Houſe. Now <hi>Saturn</hi> has ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon the Brain too, but then his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences bring forth more of <hi>imagination</hi> and <hi>policy</hi> than real wit, and his action worketh as <hi>ſlow</hi> as <hi>Mercury</hi> does <hi>ſwift;</hi> his chiefeſt work is acted upon matter of <hi>Husbandry,</hi> in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of which he exceedeth, producing nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Husbandmen, ſaving that withall he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines them to be too <hi>covetous;</hi> but for matter
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:101289:66"/>
of <hi>Health</hi> he is very infortunate, and breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth abundance of cold, dull, and ſlow diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, that laſt long where they happen, and that inſomuch that if <hi>Saturn</hi> be Lord of any ill Houſe, he rarely fails of killing a Native.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, the Planet <hi>Jupiter</hi> is of a nature by himſelf, ſingularly good; for temper he ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates <hi>hot</hi> and <hi>moiſt,</hi> and that equally and well-tempered; his great buſineſs is to ſtrengthen health and life; and this, if he be well dignified, and in conjunction with the <hi>Sun</hi> or <hi>Moon,</hi> or in the <hi>Aſcendent,</hi> he performs to purpoſe; but withall, he fortunates in all caſes, as if he be joyned with <hi>Venus,</hi> or in the <hi>Sixth Houſe,</hi> he fortunates in <hi>Wiving;</hi> if joyned with <hi>Mars,</hi> he fortunates in <hi>War;</hi> if joyned with <hi>Saturn</hi> in <hi>Husbandry,</hi> he makes a man lucky; if joyned with <hi>Mercury,</hi> he ſtrengthens the Brain and Wit; if joyned with <hi>Sol,</hi> he makes a moſt Princely brave perſon: And laſtly, be he alone, and any whit ſtrong, he worketh a good digeſtion, a ſtrong body, a religious and honeſt mind, and influenceth men to be <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Judges, Lawyers,</hi> and ſuch like.</p>
                     <p>Now according to theſe Natures of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, ſuch are all men, according as the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets have predominancy in them; and ſuch are all manner of Herbs and Plants that grow in the field: Some are influenced by <hi>Saturn,</hi> and thence are <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>dry;</hi> others by <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi> and thence are <hi>hot</hi> and <hi>moiſt;</hi> one by an order of <hi>Mars</hi> draws nothing but poiſon to its roots; and another by the the ſweet influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of <hi>Venus,</hi> ſucks nothing but the ſweet ſap of the Earth into all its Fibres. If <hi>Saturn</hi> or <hi>Mars</hi> riſe with a Birth, or within the Degree aſcending, it's ten to one but the Child dies that year, unleſs <hi>Jupiter</hi> or <hi>Venus</hi> by their
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:101289:66"/>
friendly beams interpoſe. And to this purpoſe have we as full a comprobation or atteſtation of the truth of what we ſay, as the <hi>Phyſician</hi> has of the nature of Herbs when he taſtes them, whether they be hot or cold, or what they be good for, either as to cure or kill.</p>

For as the Phyſician attains unto the skill in Medecines by trial and experience, ſo the Arologer to the skill in Prognoſtication by the Stars, by trial and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. Many things there are in Nature which plainly come to paſs, and yet by no ſenſible means can it be diſcerned how, or which way they are effected: And hence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows it, that there are ſecret, indiſcernable, inſenſible, and impalpable tracks in Nature, beyond all what we are able to perceive; and becauſe they are ſo, therefore ſay we, theſe things are not brought about by any Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary or Terreſtrial Acts; for if ſo, we could have catch'd it in our ſenſes, and the reaſon of it in our fancies; and becauſe by Elementary or Earthly means they are not acted, and yet acted they are, and that by means too, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore follows it, that by ſomething elſe between us and the Emperial Preſence of the Creator they muſt be acted; and there being nothing elſe but the Heavens between us and the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors Emperial Preſence, theſe Heavens and Heavenly Bodies muſt be the means of thoſe actings; and that not onely by ſenſible and palpable acts, as by <hi>heat, moiſture, drought,</hi> and <hi>coldneſs,</hi> but by curious, ſecret, and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:101289:67"/>
ways; as for inſtance, A man is ſtrongly ſmitten on a ſudden with a Feveriſh diſtemper, very violent and head-ſtrong, and yet nothing can be diſcerned how or which way it comes about; the moſt Learned of Phyſicians cannot, by any depth of natural reaſon ſay how it was cauſed, ſo as to ſhew, that do another man the like act, and ſuch another Fever ſhall in the ſame manner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide him alſo: But then look into the ſick mans Nativity, and you have it preſently, be ſure you ſhall have the Body, or ſome ill aſpect of the Planet <hi>Mars,</hi> or ſome violent Star un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der direction at that very point of time as the Promittor to the Significator; and where ever you find ſuch a Direction again in another Nativity under the ſame qualification, it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly produceth the ſame effect. And this we have obſerved by much experience and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation: And therefore ſay we, it was not ſo much a catching cold, or an infection that gave ſuch a diſtemper, but the ill influence of <hi>Mars,</hi> that unſeen or felt gave a ſecret blow that touched a man at his very heart blood, and the cold or infection were but inſtruments; for another man catcheth cold, and meets with infection as much as he, and yet is not once ſick. Juſt after the ſame rate you find a perſon on the ſudden, from wiſe and diſcreet, becomes Lunatick or ſtark mad; and you can give no reaſon at all of it in Nature, ſaving that in Aſtrology ſay we, all perſons that have the <hi>Moon</hi> in a Nativity in no aſpect of <hi>Mercury,</hi> and at the ſame time afflicted by the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, one or both of them ſhall be ſure to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thus, as what time the <hi>Moon</hi> comes to the ill aſpect of that Infortune. And thus by theſe, and ſuch like Rules as theſe, attain we
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:101289:67"/>
to a certain ſtock of skill in Aſtrology, and what this ſtock is, be it more or leſs; (for we pretend not to any thing of perfection) we learn one from another, as Boys learn their Grammar-Leſſons at School, and that by means of an honeſt Tutor, without any thing of an infernal Dictator.</p>

Among the many Sciences, in the ſtudy where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb facs="tcp:101289:73"/>
holy Fame doth dwell, next unto <hi>Theology,</hi> that of Aſtrology deſerves place in one of the higheſt Forms; as that, which ſhews forth the glorious Wiſdom of the Creatour of all things, in his Eternal Providence in the Tracts of Nature, as by the Study therein they do moſt excellently appear; and by the Experience of the Skill of that Wiſdom in the acts of things paſt, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheweth many Excellent Marks and Tokens of things to come, to the great advantage of all particular perſons converſant therein, and are fit to make a good Uſe thereof. When <hi>David</hi> was in <hi>Keilah,</hi> and heard that <hi>Saul</hi> was coming to beſiege him in that Town, he was deſirous to know the truth, <hi>Whether he was coming, yea, or no?</hi> And if yea, then, <hi>Whether the men of Keilah would be true to him, or would betray him?</hi> And <hi>This,</hi> becauſe he had no means to underſtand timely enough to ſtand with his ſafety by a Meſſenger, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by the <hi>Prieſt</hi> and the <hi>Ephod,</hi>

[1 Sam. 23.6, 9, 10, 11, 12.] and it was anſwered rightly, to his great benefit and ſafeguard. Now it is ſomewhat doubtful, by what means this way of Prophecy by the <hi>Ephod</hi> was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, ſome gueſſing one way, and ſome another: but that which with me ſeemeth moſt probable, is, That the <hi>Ephod</hi> being upon the Prieſts back, he was immediately inſpired from God above, ſo as to be able to give an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the queſtion demanded. And my reaſon for it is, becauſe of <hi>Caiphas</hi> the High Prieſt, who ſitting in Council in his Prieſtly Robes, as the manner was to do, though a bad man, yet was <hi>able to propheſy, what would follow of the Debate they were then upon,</hi> [Joh. 11.49, 50, 51.] And now as it pleaſed God to help <hi>David</hi> at his Need, by a Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warning of what would follow at that time, ſo it ſeems it was the cuſtomary practice of his Mercy and Goodneſs, at all times <hi>to do nothing of any conſequence,</hi> without <hi>revealing much unto his Prophets</hi>

aforehand, [<hi>Amos</hi> 3.7.] And the ſame Mercy and Good Will as in thoſe days he had, ſo has he ſtill: and though <hi>Revelations</hi> and <hi>Inſpirations</hi> be not uſual now adayes, as they were in old time; yet, what by natural Induſtry, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Obſervation, gained from the Stars and Heavens, or any other law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful wayes, can be foreſeen and known; our Maker is ſo far from envying or being angry at it, that he really fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and applauds us for our ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>He who hath ears to hear</hi> (ſaith <hi>He) let him hear, [Mat.</hi> 13.9.] <hi>And he who hath eyes to ſee, let him ſee. And he who hath Underſtanding, let him count the number of the beaſt, [Revel.</hi> 13.9, 18.] And now that there is ſuch a Natural skill of <hi>foreknowledg</hi> by the <hi>Stars</hi> and <hi>Heavens</hi> to be gained, the Doctor himſelf hath acknowledged, and ſo has our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſaid as much, [<hi>Matth.</hi> 16.2, 3. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.54, 55, 56.] And we do not pretend to an abſolute and perfect Skill, that we can know every thing, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb facs="tcp:101289:74"/>
errour. And yet this <hi>Unkind Doctor</hi> in his great Book of <hi>Explanation,</hi> has done us ſo much injury, as to tell all the World, ſo far as his Tale can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be heard; That we <hi>Aſtrologers,</hi> meerly for our pretences to this Skill as aforeſaid, are a Company of <hi>Fools</hi> and <hi>Knaves,</hi> or <hi>Witches,</hi> and <hi>more,</hi> and <hi>worſe,</hi> if worſe can be ſaid. Nay he not only reviles us who be alive, but the dead too. Now <hi>good Reader,</hi> theſe following lines, are not only to clear our ſelves, that though we do ſtudy and uſe <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> and are not aſhamed to be called <hi>Aſtrologers,</hi> yet are we not <hi>ſuch ill men</hi> as he ſayes we are; but contrarily we deſire no longer to live, nor to own this Sacred Science, than we are able to prove, and ſhew, it to be a Science truly Sacred, and of great Uſe unto Mankind in general, or any body that ſhall make a good Uſe of it in particular. I am my ſelf a <hi>Divine,</hi> and am heartily ſorry I am to write
<pb facs="tcp:101289:75"/>
againſt a Divine. And it has been my great Care (God knowes) in all this Anſwer of Defence, to give good words, and no ill language. But ſo it is, that the Doctor has been ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry foul upon us, that in mine own neceſſary defence, do what I could<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have hit him now and then, and if it was in the Eyes or in the Mouth, I am ſorry for it, it could not be holpen, he is to thank himſelf for it. The truth is, (as I am credibly informed, and his Pen ſhews it) He was a man ſtained (when he wrote) with the Schiſme of the late Times; and it is generally ſeen and found, that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were Presbyterians or Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, thoſe men generally were wont to be very peremptory, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial, and angry in moſt of their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. But having cleared <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> my <hi>Self,</hi> and my good Brethren that are <hi>Aſtrologers,</hi> I have done, and I hope, when the Doctor ſhall ſee his
<pb facs="tcp:101289:75"/>
Errours by what I have done, he will be ſorry for the Slaunders, and all the hard words he has given us; and I for my ſhare am heartily apt and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to forgive him.</p>

So on the other ſide, ſuppoſe a man, a famous Scholar, endued with all manner of profound learning; only being of a melancholly, and reſerved humour, he hath no phancy to the knack of Muſick, and neither does he underſtand it, or care to learn: Yet what a wretch would he be eſteemed by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of mankind, ſhould he therefore write a Treatiſe againſt Muſick, as a ſtudy wholly <hi>groundleſs and frivolous,</hi> and therefore a vain and accurſed Art; that draws in men to Blaſpheme God, and to make Religion a meer ſong, and by degrees uſeleſs to the World, (as the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ſays of <hi>Aſtrology</hi>) and all meerly upon this account, becauſe himſelf does not underſtand it, whether it be by Nature, or by Art, or by Witchcraft, or by God, or by the Devil, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And if a man chance to ſtudy Muſick, that is of this kind of humour, he muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly fail of his endeavours, becauſe Nature has not cut him out for melody: But when this comes to paſs, then (have he not the more go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of himſelf) immediatly he is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with ſuch an Envy againſt the ſtudy of

But yet there's no ſuch Creature amongſt us as the <hi>Doctor</hi> coines, who imagins as if ♂ could <hi>heat the Mountains, and burn up the Graſs,</hi> as does ☉. No, this parching heat of the Planet ♂ is not a ſenſible or palpable heat, which appears outwardly; but rather is it a <hi>ſecret Influence,</hi> which inſenſibly works upon the inwards of us Mortals, and ſuch, as by means of its by-paths, we cannot thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly track; it brings about violent Feavers, hot and burning drineſs of the Throat, burning fits of the Ague, and all ſuch violently hot Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.

like ♂, for the ☉ gives a more truly radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and natural heat of himſelf, but ♂ infects with a conſuming rather then an enlivening heat. Now to be <hi>hot and dry</hi> in this ſence, is utterly a different thing, from that nature of the ☉ which is ſenſibly hot and burning outwardly, and this either the <hi>Doctor</hi> did not know, which, if ſo, where was the <hi>inſufferable Fool</hi> then?

(ſay they) <hi>that the influence of the</hi> Pole Star <hi>pierces through the bowels of the Earth, and is a notorious Argument of the ſecret and irreſiſtible virtue of the reſt of the Heavens.</hi>] Thus writes the <hi>Doctor</hi> by way of quotation out of Sir <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopher Heydon,</hi> as who would ſay, what might be argued on behalf of <hi>Aſtrology.</hi> And the truth is, the <hi>Doctor</hi> has ſo ingeniouſly compiled the <hi>Arguments</hi> on <hi>Aſtrologies</hi> behalf altogether in one entire Chapter, and ſet them out in ſuch <hi>neat apparel,</hi> and in ſo <hi>good order;</hi> (Ch. 15.) that as they ſtand holding together ſo unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly, and maintaining their cauſe ſo chearfully, methinks they look ſo confidently ſweetly on the Oppoſer, as if they were at ſtrife, whether to wooe or daunt the Adverſary to their ſide.

                     <p>But however to return unto his <hi>Conceſſions,</hi> and they compared with the Objection on the other ſide, unto which they refer: Firſt, <hi>Does the</hi> Moon <hi>ſwell many things with moiſture in her Full?</hi> (as is granted,) And doe's <hi>this ſwelling with
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:101289:97"/>

For does he not talk of a <hi>liquidneſs,</hi> which from without <hi>inſinuate</hi>'s into thoſe <hi>Brains</hi> and <hi>Eyes?</hi> And that collected from an <hi>Aiery</hi> and <hi>Vapourous</hi> matter too? But I wonder how poſſibly this crafty <hi>liquidneſs</hi> got through the head, the skin and skull, and without once ſtirring thoſe more outward parts, with any kind of alteration, wrought only upon the <hi>Brain,</hi> which was ſo cloſe lockt up within. For do we not eaſily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that when ſuch a <hi>liquidneſs</hi> invades the kernel of any Fruit, it never toucheth that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, until both husk and ſhell are either rotted off, or ſo ſwell'd in ſubſtance as to cleave inſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der? But beſides, every Novice in Husbandry does know, that this kind of <hi>liquidneſs,</hi> though it can <hi>inſinuate,</hi> yet is it not ſo <hi>quick</hi> at it: There are many Seeds, as Haws, and Hollibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and others, whoſe Shels are not near ſo thick and hard as are the Skulls of Beaſts, and yet is it almoſt a two Years time before this <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quidneſs</hi>

can thorowly act upon them: And yet ſhall we be ſo thick skin'd as to imagin, as if this <hi>ſluggiſh Labourer</hi> could dig thorow, and dive beyond skin and skull in a Nights time, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon in another! But what is worſt of all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how abſurd is it to phancy, as if the <hi>fleſh</hi> of <hi>Senſitive Animals</hi> was wrought upon by <hi>liquid inſinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> as are the <hi>Stems, Roots</hi> and <hi>Seeds</hi> of <hi>Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Plants!</hi> For although outward applications may have ſo much influence upon the <hi>Eye</hi> or <hi>Brain,</hi> ſo as to pain or eaſe them by inſinuating Powers, yet that Power which <hi>nouriſhes,</hi> and ſo by conſequence makes full <hi>Brains</hi> and <hi>Eyes,</hi> or for want of exerciſe <hi>empties,</hi> and makes leſs Brains, or by any other way cauſes the <hi>Eye</hi> or <hi>Brain to thrive</hi> or <hi>diminiſh,</hi> muſt neceſſarily be maintain'd from within, from the Stomach and Belly, and not meerly from any act of <hi>Sun</hi> or <hi>Moon</hi> from without only. And does the <hi>Moon</hi> work this ſwelling of <hi>Eyes</hi> and <hi>Brains?</hi> Why yes, that's granted, and if ſo, then needs muſt ſhe do it by working upon the Stomach and Blood of that Beaſt or Cat, whoſe Eyes or Brains ſhe ſwells; and if ſo, how then can it be otherwiſe, but that ſhe hath an <hi>influence,</hi> whereby at certain times ſhe affords more virtue to the <hi>food,</hi> and <hi>blood,</hi> by means whereof it feeds more full and thriving at ſometimes more then at other ſome? For, take a certain quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of duſt, and mingle it with water and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and all the Art that may be, and ſeeth or bake it, and it thrives not after all, as to be more or leſs: But then take a certain quantity of Meal, and uſe it after the ſame manner, and loe it comes forth of the Oven, or the Pot, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt twice as big as it went in, and this it does by reaſon of that virtue which lodgeth in the Seed whereof it was made. And therefore by
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:101289:98"/>
the ſame rule ſay we of the ſwelled Eyes or Brains, that it was not the meer <hi>liquidneſs,</hi> or any kind of <hi>hotneſs</hi> which made them ſo, but a certain <hi>virtue</hi> ſecretly infuſed into the food, and blood which made them thrive thus; And this is it, which the <hi>Moon hath done,</hi> (as is confeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.) And therefore follows it unavoidably, that the <hi>Moon</hi> not only does ſuch things, but that by a certain influence ſhe does it, whereby ſhe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtils her <hi>virtue</hi> ſometimes more, and ſometimes leſs.</p>

But no, ſays the <hi>Doctor,</hi> the <hi>Moon</hi> does it by a <hi>rational ground,</hi> [Ch. 16. §. 4.] And to prove this rational ground, he quotes <hi>Des Chartes,</hi> and from him affirms, <hi>That the Ellipſis of the Caeleſtial matter is ſtreitned by the</hi> Moon's <hi>Body, which makes the Æther flow more ſwift; which is a plain and Mechanical Solution of the</hi> Phaenomenon. Thus contrive's the <hi>Doctor,</hi> as if the <hi>Moon</hi> cauſed this <hi>Ebbing and Flowing</hi> of the Seas, but not by any attractive or expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Virtue or Influence, but as if the Boys with a great Beſome, were driving the water of the Kennel ſometimes this way, and ſometimes that, with a violent drift; or as if ſome great ſtone haled up the River and back again, ſhould cauſe the rowling of the water to and fro. Now the truth is, ſuch things may be, here below with us. But to ſay what is done beyond and above the <hi>Air,</hi> how come we I wonder to know that? And yet ſays the <hi>Doctor,</hi> this is a <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical Solution.</hi> But not ſo plain by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, unleſs we know better, of what kind of nature that Caeleſtial matter is he treats of, or
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:101289:98"/>
that he could tell us. For do not we know that the Air is a ſubtil and a curiouſly made thin Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which aptly and eaſily with very ſmall or no force upon its next Neighbour makes way for greateſt Bodies to peirce and paſs thorow it; and we have much of reaſon to beleive, that the Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial matter is much more ſubtil then that. So as it can make room enough for the paſſage of the <hi>Moon</hi>'s Body thorow and thorow it to and fro, without any the leaſt diſturbance to the <hi>Air</hi> or <hi>Water.</hi> But on the contrary, that there is no ſuch thing in nature, appears by this, in that whilſt the waters are carried hither and thither by the power of the <hi>Moon,</hi> the <hi>Winds</hi> are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times <hi>contrarily</hi> diſpoſed. For were the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters driven by a force of the <hi>Moon</hi>'s Body drive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Caeleſtial matter, and that the <hi>Air,</hi> and the <hi>Air</hi> the <hi>Waters:</hi> Then would the Winds al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo (which are lighter then the Waters) be driven alſo by the ſame violent <hi>Air,</hi> even as the <hi>Waters</hi> are; but this we ſee is not ſo, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neither can be the other. But this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment rather looks much like that of a blunt Countrey Gentleman's, who underſtanding but little of the <hi>Syſtem of the World,</hi> conceited the Earth to be faſtened unto the North and South Poles by great and maſſy Cakes of Ice, upon which not hanging ſo ſteady, but that it is tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered to and fro by the motion of the <hi>Moon;</hi> which therefore as it reels towards the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> ſwaggles the whole water of the Sea, floting the ſame way; and as it returns back again Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, brings all the whole Sea with a ſwaggle back again to Landwards upon us. Now the truth is, let them conceit this way and the other what they can; there is no man can propoſe any certain Mechanical way, whereby this rare Feat ſhould be thus wrought. It is therefore enough

for our matter at this time, that the <hi>Doctor</hi> has granted it to happen certainly by means of the <hi>Moon.</hi> For hence are we able to ſay by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from our <hi>Adverſaries,</hi> that the <hi>Moon</hi>

ſo, why then beyond that <hi>Roſſebury</hi> and thoſe three Miles of it, does the Needle turn <hi>North-wards,</hi> and not rather towards <hi>Roſſebury?</hi> Is this <hi>Magnetiſme</hi> in the <hi>Earth</hi> then; why if ſo, its in no one part or place of the Earth it ſeems, but in ſeveral; it is about <hi>Roſſebury,</hi> and <hi>beyond Roſſebury</hi> more <hi>North,</hi> and who knows where the end of it is there?

Or are the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s Principles as <hi>groundleſs</hi> and <hi>frivolous</hi> nay and <hi>contradictious</hi> as our's of <hi>Aſtrology?</hi> It ſeems there is a ſtrange ſympathy between the nature of the <hi>Polar Star</hi> and the <hi>Magnet Stone:</hi> This Stone, if it be nigh to the Needle, has it ſeems a palpable power to attract the Needle towards it ſelf. And this it can do (as ſome ſay who have ſeen the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) though there be the thickneſs of a Table Board, between the Stone and the Needle. And in this caſe, the Magnet leads away the Needle to the <hi>Polar Star.</hi> But this is the truth of the caſe about <hi>Roſſebury,</hi> It ſeems there is ſome <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net Rocks</hi> there abouts, which draw the <hi>Needle</hi> round as it comes near to every of them; and being near hand, they draw away the <hi>Needle</hi> from the <hi>Polar Star.</hi> But after a ſmall diſtance, their virtue fails, and then the <hi>Polar Star</hi> draws it again. But to conclude, is this virtue of <hi>Magnetiſme</hi> in the Earth, or any part of it, as the <hi>Doctor</hi> ſays? Why then this power of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting the <hi>Needle</hi> would be but weak, and at a certain diſtance only; for ſo the <hi>Magnetick</hi> Rocks at or near <hi>Roſſebury</hi> work but within their diſtance, and that's but ſmall and very mean. But a <hi>Magnetiſme</hi> there is, which draws as far as from the <hi>North Pole</hi> unto beyond the <hi>Tropick</hi> of <hi>Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn,</hi> and that through the very Body of the

                     <p>But Secondly, That if the <hi>Moon</hi> which is <hi>one Planet,</hi> have <hi>ſuch and ſuch influences,</hi> which are ſo <hi>apparent as they cannot be denied,</hi> what hinders, but it may aptly follow that her <hi>fellow Planets</hi> may have <hi>influences</hi> too, though perhaps not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſo apparently to be diſcerned. The <hi>Planets</hi> appear to us, as ſo many Creatures all of a <hi>kind.</hi> And in ſuch a caſe, whatſoever is the <hi>property</hi> of one of them as a Planet, may very ſafely be applied to the other.

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:101289:106"/>
that a Gooſe does naturally <hi>gaggle,</hi> I am apt to think that all Geeſe can do ſo too. So there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when I find that the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> have power of caſting out their <hi>Influences,</hi> each of them their proper <hi>Influences,</hi> I conclude that their fellow Planets can <hi>caſt influences</hi> too, though all of them their proper influences.

But for matter of <hi>experience,</hi> we who have made the tryal, do find by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, all that is written of the other Planets and their proper <hi>influences</hi> to be true.

But the <hi>Doctor</hi> not able to ſay againſt it, yet crys out <hi>unſufferable folly.</hi> And in the next Section, inſtead of arguing to the ſame kind of diſcourſe, all the Argument he brings, is nothing elſe but a <hi>loading Aſtrology</hi> with Lies and Slanders; <hi>As if without any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or experience that this is the cauſe of that, we attribute one thing for another.</hi>] And now what ſhall we, or need we to anſwer in this caſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be, that the <hi>Doctor</hi> may be aſhamed to

                     <p>Secondly, As the parts of the Earth have their ſeveral virtues, as ſome do naturally and aptly bring forth Fur, others Broom, and others Fern, ſo theſe parts of the Heavens have alſo their ſeveral operations.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, As any part of the Earth is made more fruitful by means of compaſs, dung or ſoil applied to the mending thereof; even ſo this point of the Ecliptick, where the <hi>Moon</hi> makes her paſſage over it, is found extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily exceeding in operation above the other parts of the Ecliptick: But when this paſſage of the <hi>Moon</hi> happeneth to fall out in the Sign of ♊ and ♐, and eſpecially in the third degree of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; then appears it, that the ☊ in the one, and the ☋ in the other, hath more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary operation, which is called their <hi>Exaltation:</hi> And the truth of this is evident by the ſame kind of experience, as is that of the virtue of the <hi>weapon-ſalve,</hi> or as thoſe are of any of the potions or Medicines commended to us by our Phyſicians.

                        <hi>Their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative</hi> (he ſays) <hi>is deſtroyed by the firſt general Argument, becauſe the parts of the Sign are as fictitious as the whole.</hi>] When the <hi>Doctor</hi> is at a full point, as his Ha hah will extend no farther, then flies he to the main ſhift, <hi>That there is no Zodiack,</hi> or that the <hi>Signs</hi> of the Zodiack are all but <hi>meer imaginary things.</hi>] But whatever they are <hi>imaginary</hi> to us, who never aſcended up ſo high as to obſerve the bound-marks of the ſeveral Signs; yet for certain, there is an <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> as no man can deny: And if there be an Heaven, then may this Heaven be divided into parts, and that as well into <hi>twelve</hi> equal parts, as well as <hi>two,</hi> and this all men muſt confeſs. And if ſo, then every of thoſe twelve parts may be alſo ſubdivided into thirty equal parts, by the ſame general confeſſion, and every one of thoſe <hi>twelve,</hi> and thoſe 30 parts, muſt be as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the parts of Heaven, as Heaven it ſelf is a real, and no <hi>imaginary</hi> Body. And if the whole, and parts be real, then are they no ſuch fictitious things, as the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s whimſi's do imagin.

beleive there is any ſuch thing as a <hi>Ram</hi> or <hi>Lion</hi> in Heaven.

Let it be the firſt day, and ſecond day, inſtead of <hi>Sunday,</hi> and <hi>Munday.</hi> And let it be the firſt 30 degrees after the <hi>Æqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox,</hi> and then the ſecond 30, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> and not ♈, ♉, nor the reſt, will that pleaſe? Or if it may not be the Conſtellation of the <hi>Ram,</hi> or the <hi>Bull,</hi> let it be a certain number of Stars in ſuch and ſuch forms imagined in the ſhape of a <hi>Ram,</hi> and a <hi>Bull.</hi> Or it may be he thinks of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, as a Shepheard on <hi>Grimsbury Green</hi> did of the <hi>Sea,</hi> who when he heard of a Merchant how he ſailed ſo many Leagues upon the Waters, and inquiring what thoſe Leagues were, was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That they were imaginary diſtances in their Sailing, he preſently concluded that the Sea was therefore <hi>imaginary,</hi> and ſo was the Ship they ſailed in, and finally he would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the Merchant himſelf imaginary too, if he had not drew his Sword, and frighted him into the Faith, that he was really ſome body. But for want of ſuch a ſenſible Argument the <hi>Doctor</hi> goes madly on in a kind of Enthuſiaſtic humour, and concludes, That the <hi>Heaven</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and the <hi>parts</hi> of Heaven are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and therefore the dignity of <hi>Carpentum,</hi> or the Royal Seat is a meer nothing, and <hi>Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For were it not ſo, he would have bethought himſelf, that a <hi>Walnut</hi> is firſt bitter on the outſide unto 9 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of diſtaſt unto the Palat, and yet dig thorow that outward rind unto the kernel, and you have as many degrees of good taſt, and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, you are no ſooner paſs't the kernel but you arrive at the 5 degrees of diſtaſt again. Loe how Nature has propoſed him an every days pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern

plain and common, of her more curious and ſecret Contrives! And yet ſee how the <hi>Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> falls to wondring and exclaiming at that which a Boy of five years of age knows to be a plain caſe! Look but into an Honey-comb where the pots ſtand as thick as can be ſet each by other, and yet may be ſeen one fortified with <hi>Honey</hi> as full and ſweet as one would wiſh, and the very next debilitated by reaſon of the ſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bee in it; as venemous as one would think could be hardly poſſible for ſuch a little Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to bring forth, and yet the very next pot as full of Honey again. Or behold but the Roſie buſh, how it's ſet with now a ſweet Roſe, and next an offenſive prickle, and then a Roſe again. Why then wonder we, that in the Heaven there ſhould be the like! But if the <hi>Doctor</hi> cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend ſo much juſt in his whimſical Mood, let him take a nap, and by that he wakes again, it will be plain to him. But again he's cumbred, <hi>That alſo is notoriouſly fooliſh,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that</hi> ♄ ♃ <hi>and</hi> ♂ <hi>from their</hi> ☌ <hi>with</hi> ☉, <hi>unto their</hi> ☍, <hi>ſhould have two Fortitudes, and yet from</hi> ☍ <hi>to</hi> ☌ <hi>again, they ſhould have as many debilities. For in a great part of that Semicircle which carries from</hi> ☍ <hi>to</hi> ☌, <hi>they are far nearer, and therefore much ſtronger then in the beginning of that Semicircle which leads from</hi> ☌ <hi>to</hi> ☍.] Here he bewrays more of his old ignorance, as if the fortitude of the Planets ſtood meerly upon their <hi>nearneſs in diſtance,</hi> which is no ſuch matter. For it is not in Heaven as on Earth, nor with the Planets as with Fire, which heats moſt as we approach neareſt. Next he quarrels at the fortitudes and debilities of <hi>Direct, Stationary</hi> and <hi>Retrogade, as if grounded on a miſtake of the Syſtem of the World, and ignorance of the Earth's annual moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and from an Idiotick application of accidents
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:101289:119"/>
or phraſes amongſt men,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And therefore muſt Stationary be two debilities, Retrogade no leſs then five, but Direct five Fortitudes, whereas in reaſon Stationary ſhould ſeal on the effect of the Planet more ſure. But the truth is, a Planet is neither Stationary nor Retrogade, but in appearance only, and therefore theſe debilities are but imaginary.</hi>] We have had even enough of the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s own Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Idleneſs too, concerning this diſcourſe of the <hi>miſtaking the Syſteme of the World,</hi> and truly there is no need of rubbing the ſore place over again. As for his <hi>Idiotick Phraſes,</hi> they are very fit reſemblances, but ſure the Doctor is not ſo ſimple, as in good earneſt to ſuppoſe us by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch, led into a <hi>miſtake</hi> as he alledges, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſays. His cheif weight of Argument falls heavieſt upon the <hi>Stationary debility,</hi> as if the <hi>delay of the Planet</hi> in a place, <hi>ſhould ſeal the ſurer effect.</hi>

                        </note> But experience and reaſon joining together, do evidence the contrary, namely that the <hi>Stationary Planet</hi> is ſtanded in the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his <hi>virtues,</hi> as well as of his <hi>Body,</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that ſtation. And whereas he deny's that the Planet is ever <hi>Stationary</hi> or <hi>Retrograde,</hi> ſave only in <hi>appearance,</hi> it is not ſo. For although the Planet of it ſelf make no returns, but is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways moving directly on, yet going round his Circle, after he has paſſed his utmoſt diſtance as we ſtand, he really returns upon us in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ambulation, and the time between this going on and return, is unto us a real Station, his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion looking upon us for ſome days<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> altogether from the very ſame point. But however were the Retrogradation and Station no more but in a meer appearance, yet does it not follow but the debilities ariſing from that appearance ſhall be real, and not imaginary.

For the Planets take their charge every one of them in order. And unto every new imployment they receive a new charge. A Child in the Womb is but an Appendix to the Mother, and is nouriſhed by the blood which nouriſhes her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as if a part of herſelf 'til ſeparated from her.

Which takes away all certainty of Computation, by</hi> accidentia Nati.] This may moſt of it be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto the very laſt Conſequence and Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that therefore it takes away all certainty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For thus far agrees our Maxim in Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, <hi>Sapiens dominabitur Aſtris.</hi> But to comply with the Doctor's ſlackneſs of apprehenſion in this ſort of learning, I'le make it appear to him by examples of his own challenging.</p>
                     <p>And Firſt, As for Diſeaſes, and particularly to inſtance in a Feaver, as the <hi>malevolent</hi> Aſpect of ♂ draws on, it corrupts the Food we take, in its turning into blood, and thence working by this corrupted blood, diſturbances follow in the Heart and Head, and the other parts of the Body, all which, no free Agency is poſſibly able to prevent: But now beſides this, together with this corrupting influence the Planet alſo works a certain promptitude unto exceſs, in taking in meats, and that eſpecially in deſire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch kind of meats as naturally heighten and inflame the Diſtemper. And here is it, that the <hi>free agency</hi> of man lies, <hi>Sapiens dominabitur</hi> &amp;c. <hi>A wiſe man can rule the Stars,</hi> that is, he can deny himſelf when he feels a promptneſs to ſuch things as will certainly harm him, and thus by ſtriving againſt this part of the Influence he abſteins, and by accuſtoming himſelf thereto, begets an habit of abſtinence, and by virtue of that habit he abates much of the Diſeaſes force, whence it becomes far leſs then otherwiſe it would have been, and it comes not until later, and ends ſooner then elſe it would have done. Whereas contrarily, a Fool by yeilding to the influence, heightens and haſtens the Diſtemper. But yet notwithſtanding, all the wiſe man's skill and power of Free-will, the body of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe abides, and cannot be avoided. And here
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:101289:123"/>
lies the accident, which maugre the Doctor's en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, finds out the time of Birth aright. And then for matter of Impriſonment; as the <hi>male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent</hi> Aſpects of ſuch Planets, which have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to that effect, draw on, all the man's Words, Geſtures and Actions tend ſo unluckily as to beget differences with Authority in him, and to ſubject him unto the frowns of the ſame, and with all ſuch an unluckineſs encounters the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all his affairs, that beyond expectation, each ſtep haſtens on the Fate of his reſtraint. And this although wiſe men may mitigate, and Fools exaſperate, yet no man can wholy evade. This therefore is another ſure accident which no free <hi>Agency</hi> is poſſibly able to undo. Once more, as for matter of Preferment, As the good Aſpects come on, a certain luckineſs accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies each affair, ſo as all things, words and acts drive it on. And now ſuppoſe we the man ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo debauch't with wickedneſs and folly, however he may diſgrace and ſomwhat harm his good Fortunes, yet overturn it he cannot, no though himſelf will's it, yet comes it upon him as it were with a kind of defiance. A wiſe man may add to his preferment, by compliance with his good Stars, and here a free <hi>Agent</hi> would interrupt and defeat him by lies or treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or aſſault, or ſtab, of any ſuch like: But then his good Stars defends him with ſuch a luck, as every plot to the contrary is defeated by them. Nay theſe good Stars will many times ſo operate upon the turns and conſtructions of Affairs, as the thus riſing Subject ſhall be cleared of all Evil-willers, that can intend him harm by making them freinds. And thus the Subject of preferment has his Free-will, and all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons he has to do with have theirs, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any the leſt interruption, and yet this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:101289:123"/>
drives on as it were in deſpight of all free Agency. But then in [§. 16.] the <hi>Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> has another fling at the <hi>manner</hi> of working out the time of Birth from theſe Accidents, which he exclaims againſt as <hi>very frivolous.</hi> This <hi>manner</hi> of working (he ſays) is either by <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, Tranſition, or Direction.</hi> Againſt theſe he rails,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Altogether, calling them <hi>meer Phancy</hi>'s <hi>and Figments.</hi> And then againſt <hi>Profection</hi> in particular, he falls fowl, ſaying, <hi>Is it any where but in their own brain?</hi> But produces nothing of <hi>abſurdity</hi> againſt it, and therefore needs no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, As for <hi>Tranſition,</hi> he crys <hi>O mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous</hi> at it, <hi>that a Planet by paſſing the ſame place in which it ſelf or other Planets were at the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, ſhould cauſe ſome notable change in the party born! As if the Planets walked the rounds with perfumed Socks, or that they ſmelt ſtronger at the Nativity, then at other times, and that another Planet come into the place thereof, ſhould exult in the Scent, or the ſame increaſe the Smell: Or what is it can adhere in theſe points of Heaven, that the Planets were found in, at the Nativity?

At this rate was a certain Quaker's anſwer I have heard tell of, who undertaking to know all
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:101289:124"/>
myſteries of Holy Writ, was asked, What were the <hi>Pleiades, Arcturus</hi> and <hi>Orion,</hi> ſpoken of in <hi>Job.</hi> Correcting the Propoſer of the Queſtion, he anſwered, They were not <hi>Ple-iades,</hi> but <hi>Ple-jades,</hi> and that he was a certain <hi>Heathen Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,</hi> and ſo were <hi>Arcturus,</hi> and <hi>Orion</hi> his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. Thus the <hi>Doctor</hi> having well red himſelf in the following hounds, conceits the <hi>Sun, Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi> to be all lovers of the ſame ſport, and may I make bold to gueſs at his reaſons there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as he uſes to determin ours, for what we ſay: It ſeems, as if the humour entered his Brain, becauſe he had heard tell of a <hi>Coeleſtial Hare,</hi> and of <hi>Orion and his Dogs</hi> in purſuit of her in the Heavens, and why ſhould not all Stars love the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s ſport, as well as <hi>Orion, Sirius,</hi> and <hi>Procyon?</hi> But how I wonder came the phancy of <hi>Socks</hi> into the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s head, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks conſidering their buſineſs of following the Scent, and that, as is moſt uſually, thorow all ſorts of ways, he might have allow'd them ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers at leſt, if not high Shoos! But this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit ſure was penned as the Doctor was abroad in ſome Countrey-ramble, and far from the Schools, where was no remembrance of Logical Diſcourſes: For otherwiſe had he had but <hi>Smith</hi>'s <hi>Aditus ad Logicam</hi> in his pocket, he would have ſaid with himſelf, If an Hare, or a Fox, or a Man with his Shoos on, does leave ſuch a ſcent in every ſtep he treads, that a Dog coming after ſome hours, will diſcern every place, as the foot went in the wide Feild thorow Buſhes and thorow Plains, and that ſo faſt as he can run and yet read it; and all this, although Horſes, Hogs, or other men have croſt the way twenty times over, yet the Dog will diſtinguiſh the track he follows, from them all: How much more then (no doubt) ſhall the Stars be able
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:101289:124"/>
(whoſe curious operations where e're they go, are infinitely beyond the dry and empty foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of a man's ſhoo-ſoal, to leave famous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions and remembrances of their track be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them) to make their <hi>Tranſits</hi> famous both to operate and be wrought upon, by the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets following them, and that ſo, as 'tis not ten nor twenty Courſes of any other Stars, ſhall be able to obliterate, nor yet the <hi>Tranſits</hi> of as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years over their heads.

                     <p>In [§. 3.] he comes up again with the old objection, of mans <hi>free Agency,</hi> which needs no more anſwer. Then he falls to reckoning up the <hi>multitudes who periſh by Sword, Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack, or Peſtilence, ſwept away altogether; of whom</hi> (he ſays) <hi>it's a bold ſurmiſe to imagin, that all theſe had their Interfectors anſwerable in their Nativities to their Deaths. The Artiſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi> (he ſays) <hi>dare not avouch it, but make their recourſe to Eclipſes and Blazing Stars, and therefore their Divinations are true by chance only.</hi>] But here he Errs again, the <hi>Artiſts may and do avouch it,</hi> and their recourſe to <hi>Eclipſes</hi> is but out of <hi>Modeſty,</hi> and out of abundance of <hi>cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> only. In the late great Fire of <hi>London</hi> it is apparent by many examples, and by all as can be gathered up, that every man's loſs was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted in his <hi>Nativity.</hi> But what ſhould hinder in ſuch general ſlaughters, why each man ſhould not have his <hi>Interfector</hi> in his <hi>Nativity,</hi> anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his Death, as well as in every perſon ſingly! However 'til ſuch a man can be found, in whoſe death <hi>Aſtrology</hi> miſcarry's, the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:101289:128"/>
is of no more force then a meer <hi>[think ſo:]</hi> which is as much as juſt nothing. He reckons up <hi>two diſagreeing Twin-brethren born in</hi> Scotland <hi>undiſevered, whereof one died before the other too.</hi>] But what of that? There are ſome men ſo froward, that they are ſeldom at peace in their own ſelves, eſpecially at ſuch times as Diſtempers are upon them, how much more then may two heads diſagree, although they unite in the ſame nether parts? And again, are their not many men afflicted with the <hi>dead palſey,</hi> in whom one ſide is dead, while the other is yet alive, and may it be ſo in a ſingle man, how much rather then ſhall it be in a <hi>twin or double</hi> man? But unleſs we had a full account of the exact ſtory, how can it be expected we ſhould give an exact anſwer! But it ſtill trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles him that our predictions are many of them ſo plainly true, as no more to be denied. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in [§. 4.] he urges <hi>that they are as often falſe, and therefore</hi> (ſays he) <hi>it is equal to ſay both happened by chance.</hi>] That is, if our <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical Canons</hi> ſhould prove as often falſe as true, the <hi>Doctor</hi> is in the right on it. But ſo they do not. For we are able to produce our Rules, and by our Rules to ſay this Child ſhall be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly fortunate, and that unfortunate, this Year it ſhall have a <hi>Feaver,</hi> and that Year it ſhall be well. And no longer let our <hi>Art</hi> be credited, then after this Rule we are able to predict the very truth; but when an <hi>Artiſt</hi> is preſented with a <hi>miſtimed Nativity,</hi> it muſt be by accident if he predict right, and therefore no wonder if he prove wrong. Or if he miſtake his Rules, <hi>Aſtrology</hi> muſt be pardoned from that miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. Or if <hi>Sorcerers,</hi> and if <hi>Witches</hi> pretend to <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> who are no ſuch matter, their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages concern not our door. Or if <hi>ignorant

pretenders,</hi> by ſomtimes hitting, and ſomtimes miſſing, ſlander <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> it is no blame to the Art notwithſtanding, it is its wrong rather then diſgrace. But (ſays he) <hi>in Horary Queſtions, they uſe Tricks and Jugling to deceive.</hi>] And what then, are theſe the blame of <hi>Aſtrologers,</hi> becauſe there are Cheaters amongſt them? If ſo, woe be to us Divines too.</p>

But to hold us no longer in ſuſpence, [§. 5.] he goes farther, <hi>For my part I do not doubt but Aſtrology is a part of the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> Paganiſme, <hi>whoſe Preiſts were confederate with the Devil, and ſo Daemonalatry creeps in upon Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy.

to ſuch admirers of the Art, that the ſame inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble powers put to their helping hand to bring about the effect. And ſo thoſe whoſe deaths are predicted muſt to the pot to credit the Art. For it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable to think, that by certain Laws of the great Polity of the inviſible World, they gain a right againſt a man without explicit Contract, if he be but once ſo raſh as to tamper with the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the dark Kingdom, or to practiſe in them, or any way to make uſe of them.</hi>] What a ſtrange kind of wickedneſs is here! We <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> are all of us a Relick of <hi>antient Pagans, confederate with the Devil,</hi> and guilty of <hi>Daemonalatry;</hi> and of this there is <hi>no doubt</hi> to be made, that is, the <hi>Doctor</hi> dares <hi>ſwear</hi> it. For what a man doubts not to be true, he may ſafely ſwear. I know a Clergy-man in this County, who in 1659. having been led out with ſtrength of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection as far as <hi>Bruſſels</hi> in <hi>Brabant,</hi> to ſee his Majeſty in time of his Exile, who no ſooner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, but being ſuſpected to be guilty of more Loyalty and good will to his Soveraign, then thoſe <hi>Cromwellian</hi> times could poſſibly brook; he was quickly fetch't in before the Committee of <hi>Haberdaſhers-Hall,</hi> and all he had, Body and Goods taken into Hucſters hands; it was charged againſt him, that he had been with <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> (as they then called his Sacred Majeſty) and that he prayed for him publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Pulpit. To prove theſe things, Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes were produced, who knew nothing of either, no more then the <hi>Grand-Signior</hi> or the <hi>Crim-Tartar,</hi> but however they avouch't it, and as I remember, ſwore both Articles to be true. Only the Gentleman had this priviledg left him, to put in Interrogatories of croſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination againſt theſe Witneſſes in defence of <hi>Body and Soul,</hi> in caſe of an Everlaſting Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:101289:130"/>
His Queſtions were, how they knew thoſe things, whether in God's name or the Devils? If in <hi>God</hi>'s, how they had this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, whether by Viſion, or Dream, or Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, or Inſpiration, or how elſe? For of their own knowledg he was ſure thoſe Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes could have no means of proof, and thus he went on with <hi>cloſe reaſoning</hi> (as the Doctor ſays) 'till in the end the utmoſt of the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence vaniſhed in a meer <hi>[think ſo]</hi> and ſo came to nothing, and the Gentleman was quit, notwithſtanding the evidence at firſt was ſo point blank againſt him. The <hi>Doctor</hi>'s allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on now is very near of kin to this Oath of the <hi>Cromwellian</hi> Witneſſes, for having charged us with <hi>Daemonalatry</hi> with a <hi>no doubt</hi> to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, I pray how does he prove it?</p>
                     <p>Firſt, It is not <hi>inconceivable</hi> (ſays he) that ſuch a thing <hi>may be,</hi> and then he concludes it is not <hi>unreaſonable to think</hi> it is ſo. And finally with this meer <hi>[think]</hi> of proof, he determines in [§. 6.] <hi>I ſay then theſe vagrant Daemons of the Air, either ſecretly inſinuate themſelves into the actions of Aſtrologers, or after more apparently of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themſelves to familiarity and converſe, for to grace their profeſſion by oral Revelation of things paſt, preſent, or to come, in ſuch a way as is above Humane power.</hi>] And becauſe he would be more ſure, and leſt his former <hi>[think ſo]</hi> ſhould not take ſo effectually as it deſerves, [<hi>I demand</hi> (ſays he) <hi>how it ſhall appear that</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan<hi>'s for example and</hi> Aſcletarion<hi>'s deaths, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers more punctually, that I could name, predict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by themſelves or others, were not by this famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity of Daemons, but the pure Principles of Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy? And ſo of whatſoever honour, or other events that have been found to fall out, juſt according to Aſtrological Predictions, I demand how it can be
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:101289:130"/>
proved, that Aſtrology was not here only for a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, and that a Magician or a Wizard was not underneath. By how much more accurate their predictions are, by ſo much the more cauſe of ſuſpicion.</hi> You muſt note now, that to have fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity with theſe <hi>Daemons,</hi> ſo as to predict, or tell any thing by virtue of ſuch a familiarity is puniſhable with Death, both by the Law of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man:</hi> And yet in this caſe of <hi>Life and Death,</hi> when a man is accuſed for a <hi>Wizard,</hi> and no proof can be brought againſt him but a meer <hi>[think ſo]</hi> and Judg, and Jury, are all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to acquit him; yea, but ſays the <hi>Doctor, let him prove himſelf, that he is not one,</hi> or elſe let him be truſt up. Why good Mr. <hi>Doctor</hi> (ſays the Priſoner at the Bar) if you muſt needs be anſwered to ſuch a demand, that is as unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as it is ſimple and fooliſh, know you that it is proof enough of my innocency, in that all the World can ſay nothing to the contrary, or at leaſt it is enough to ſtop the mouth of any the moſt ſlanderous Gown-man, that ever uſed his tongue to lying and ſlander. Suppoſe now a hagling Diſputant in the Schools, ſhould take upon him to prove that Dr. <hi>More</hi> is more <hi>Knave then Fool;</hi> and when he can make nothing on it, ſo as to produce any one act of his <hi>Knavery,</hi> but to the contrary rather, yet he ſticks to his points ſtill, and anſwers, let the <hi>Doctor</hi> prove it that he is not ſo, if he can. Would the <hi>Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> take this kindly think you, at the man's hands? But again, ſuppoſe we, the <hi>Devils may ſecretly inſinuate themſelves into ſome mens actions, and afterwards offer themſelves unto a greater fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity and converſe, and ſuppoſe they might gain a right againſt a man, without explicit Contract, if he be but once ſo raſh as to tamper with the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the dark Kingdom.</hi> What's all this to the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:101289:131"/>
purpoſe, unleſs there could be no ſuch things as <hi>Conjurers,</hi> but what are firſt <hi>Aſtrologers?</hi> Or ſuppoſe we, theſe Conjurers ſhould pretend (as Sr. <hi>Chriſtopher Heydon</hi> obſerves) to be <hi>Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> in order to paliate their <hi>diabolical Arts.</hi> Is <hi>Aſtrology</hi> any whit the worſe for being belied on! Our <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelf would be a <hi>Devil</hi> then too, if this might go. But ſuppoſe farther, that ſome who are <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> at firſt, ſhould after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſtep from <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> to become <hi>Wizards,</hi> or <hi>Daemonalators,</hi> muſt all neceſſarily who are <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> be ſo therefore? Do we not know, that many <hi>Divines</hi> do ſtudy unlawful <hi>Magick,</hi> and <hi>Negromancy</hi> as much or more then Divinity, muſt all <hi>Divines</hi> be <hi>Magicians</hi> therefore, and that in an evil ſenſe! We know alſo, that many <hi>Phyſicians</hi> become <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> muſt all <hi>Phyſicians</hi> be ſo therefore. But it is worth our Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on very much, how prettily the <hi>Doctor</hi> lays his Plot concerning <hi>Horary Queſtions, How the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſhould excite men to make their demands at ſuch a point of time, as the Heavens ſhould ſuit with thoſe demands in all circumſtances, according to the known rules of Aſtrology.</hi>] Now although the <hi>Devils</hi> may very poſſibly <hi>excite men to make their demands,</hi> yet be ſure the <hi>Heavens</hi> at thoſe times, it is not in the <hi>Devils</hi> power to frame at all; and yet theſe <hi>Heavens</hi> have perfect <hi>Aſtrological Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations</hi> in them according to the <hi>punctual ſolution of all Circumſtances in the demands.</hi> So that it ſhall ſeem the <hi>Doctor</hi> does verily beleive there is ſuch a thing as Aſtrology in the <hi>Heavens:</hi> Only he would have no body to deal in the skill of it, but under the <hi>Devil</hi>'s Patent. But then as for <hi>Nativities, the predictions related to them,</hi> muſt not be effected but by <hi>help of the inviſible Powers,</hi> and men's Deaths muſt be effected by the <hi>Devil,</hi> in order to make good <hi>Aſtrological Predictions.</hi>
                        <pb n="111" facs="tcp:101289:131"/>
It ſeems then with the <hi>Doctor,</hi> theſe <hi>Devils</hi> can kill whom, and when they liſt, and that as well Saints as Sinners, and the <hi>Anti-Aſtrologiſts</hi> as well as <hi>Philo-Aſtrologiſts.</hi> For thus was predict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the death of <hi>Picus,</hi> as well as <hi>Cardan,</hi> and of <hi>Gaſſendus,</hi> as well as <hi>Aſcletarion.</hi> And thus was predicted the death of that <hi>quondam Saint</hi> of the late times <hi>Oliver Cromwel.</hi> And thus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſtrictly agreed with the predictions of <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,</hi> the death of the <hi>innocent Prince of</hi> Spain, <hi>Philip Proſper,</hi> as well as the bluſtering King of <hi>Sueden,</hi> the late <hi>Charles Guſtavus,</hi> the three laſt all performed by that moſt ingenious Artiſt Mr. <hi>John Gadbury,</hi> at ſuch time, as all of them were at the higheſt of their Expectations.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That there is a double compact with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan; one direct and open, wherein Magicians and Witches, upon woful Conditions, and direful Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, enter into a mutual Covenant with evil Spirits: The other, ſecret, and indirect; wherein nothing is ſeen, or heard, or known, to be agreed upon; only by a cloſe implication, that is ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and yeilded to be done, which is inviſibly ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by diabolical operation.</hi> Theſe two Compacts, or two ways of compacting with the Devil, the <hi>Aſtrologer</hi> does acknowledg, and is well aware of. But withal he is ſufficiently ſatisfied againſt all danger of any diabolical Compact in any of <hi>his figure-caſting skill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>The ſecond ground is; that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hath not a Cauſe in Nature, according to God</hi>'s <hi>ordinary way, muſt be wrought either by good or evil Spirits: That it cannot be ſuppoſed that good Angels ſhould be at the command of ignorant, or
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:101289:134"/>
vitious Perſons of either Sex, to concur with them in ſuperſtitious Acts, done by means altogether in themſelves ineffectual and unwarrantable: And therefore that the Devil hath an unſeen hand in theſe effects, which he marvailouſly brings about, for the winning of Credit with the World, and for the obliging and engaging of his own Clients. Of this kind there is too lamentably much variety in common experience: Take an handful if you pleaſe, out of a full Sack, as the Book and the Key, the Sieve and the Sheers, for diſcovery of the Thief. The notching of a ſtick, with the number of the Warts, which we would have removed. Words and Characters of no ſignification, or ordinary form, for the curing of Diſeaſes in Man or Beaſt, more then too many whereof we find in</hi> Cornelius Agrippa, <hi>and</hi> Paracelſus. <hi>Forms of Words and Figures for the ſtanching of blood, and the pulling out of Thorns, for eaſing pain, for remedying the biting of a mad Dog. Whiſtling for a Wind,</hi> and many other ſuch like. All this the <hi>Aſtrologer</hi> readily ſubſcribes to, as moſt eminent truths. And no farther deſires he any dealing either in <hi>Calculatory,</hi> or <hi>Figure-caſting Aſtrology,</hi> then there is a <hi>Cauſe in Nature, according to God</hi>'s <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way, without either help of Angels or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,</hi> for what he does. All his whole skill in <hi>prediction,</hi> he fathereth upon the <hi>Heavens</hi> and the <hi>Stars</hi> and <hi>Planets</hi> therein: and as the <hi>Phyſician</hi> finds by the Herbs, Roots, and Flowers grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the ground, what virtue and efficacy they have to cure Wounds and Sickneſs: So the <hi>Aſtrologer</hi> has it from as ſtrong experience of the natural force and virtue of operation in the <hi>Stars of Heaven,</hi> concerning all that he ſays or knows. There is a <hi>reaſon in Nature</hi> for it, that a <hi>red Evening brings forth a fair Morrow;</hi> and experience hath found it to be ſo, and that it is
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:101289:134"/>
ſo only, and no act of <hi>Angel</hi> or <hi>Devil</hi> which makes it ſo. And there is not a <hi>tittle in Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi> which we truſt to, but what we have as much, and as true experience in, as in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of a red Evening. And as for Charms and Spells, and ſuch like traſhy Stories as have no cauſe in Nature for their Productions and Event, the <hi>Aſtrologer</hi> ſides with the Right Reverend Father, and utterly abhors them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label> Of thoſe many charming Stories reckoned up by this Holy Father, as a good cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto thouſands of poor ignorant Souls who uſe to be thereby deluded; there are only two or three, which with ſubmiſſion to riper judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I am not ſo fully ſatisfied in the unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs thereof.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, As for the <hi>rubbing of Warts with raw fleſh, and after burying that fleſh in a Dung-hill, in order that the Warts may rot away inſenſibly, as that fleſh rots.</hi> I never tried the experiment, nor do I deſire ſo to do. But yet were I ſure of truth in it, I ſhould be apt to doubt, whether there might not be as much reaſon in Nature for it, as for ſome other as unlucky experiments as ſeems this to be.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>As for the Healings of a Seventh Son, by the laying on of his hands,</hi> it ſeems to be a great ſecret. And if it come to paſs <hi>by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> only, as no doubt but it does, where a man or Woman is ſeized with ſuch a virtue unwit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to them, without deſire or inquiry after any ſuch thing; as I have heard of ſeveral ſuch Sons and Daughters who have naturally been prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſomthing extraordinary, either of ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, or the contrary; I muſt confeſs, that be there any thing of evil in the exerciſe of ſuch a gift, it is beyond my skill to apprehend the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="118" facs="tcp:101289:135"/>As for a Third, It ſeems much more unſavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, namely that <hi>Images Aſtronomically framed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der certain Conſtellations, ſhould preſerve from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral inconveniencies; as under the Sign of the</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>the figure of a Lion made in Gold, againſt Melancholick Fancies, Dropſie, Plague, Fevers,</hi> &amp;c. And yet it ſeems ſome learned men there are, who defend this kind of practice. Our pious Author mentions <hi>Cajetan</hi> for one. But withal he ſays, <hi>Leſſius</hi> might well marvel, why he ſhould defend ſuch a practice; <hi>when all the World knows how little proportion and correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence there is betwixt thoſe imaginary Signs in Heaven, and theſe real Creatures on Earth.</hi> Now as for mine own part, I confeſs that this is a practice utterly beyond my skill and experience. I have heard ſomthing ſaid in vindication of it, as if the <hi>Brazen Serpent</hi> in the Wilderneſs, ſet up by <hi>Moſes,</hi> had been nothing elſe but a meer natural experiment to cure the <hi>biting of the fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Serpents;</hi> and as if the <hi>Golden Mice,</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meruds</hi> of the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> had been the like to cure the Peſt of their Country, by reaſon of ſuch kind of Creatures. But notwithſtanding, I am very doubtful that this is but a Wile <hi>Sata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical,</hi> and far be it from me, to countenance ſuch an unſavory practice: But yet withal dare I not too peremptorily condemn it, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what ſecret actions Nature is able to bring about beyond my utmoſt gueſs.</p>
                  <p>Alſo Fourthly, <hi>As for the anointing of the weapon for the healing of the wound, though many Miles diſtant:</hi> It is well known, that many ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry intelligent men are exceeding confident of the lawfulneſs of this ſtrange kind of practice, and ſo confeſſes our pious Author, but withal he reſolves, <hi>that doubtleſs there can be nothing of Nature; ſith in all natural Agencies, there muſt
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:101289:135"/>
neceſſarily be a Contaction, either real or virtual, here is ſuch an interval, none can be: Neither can the efficacy be aſcribed to the Salve; ſince ſome others have undertaken and done the cure, by a more home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and familiar ointment;</hi> Hence our Author's opinion is, <hi>that it is the ill beſtowed Faith of the Agent, that draws on the ſucceſs from the hand of an inviſible Phyſician.</hi> This is another very doubtful practice, and the ſacred Authority of this Holy Father miſſes little of giving it an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter foil. I am unconcerned, but not knowing how far a virtual Contaction may extend, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all what I am able to imagin, I dare not condemn it.</p>
                  <p>Again Fifthly, As for the <hi>remedy of Witche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries by heating of Irons.</hi> I muſt confeſs I am not a little inclined to allow of this experiment. The hot Iron makes impreſſion upon the Devils acts, or at leaſt upon the matter of his action: And now the <hi>Devil being once reſiſted,</hi> who knows what force Nature has to make him <hi>flee?</hi> But I am not concerned here neither, any ways to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Holy Father, his authority againſt it, being of more force with me, then my fancy for it.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>7</label> Laſtly, Amongſt the reſt of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous practices ſavouring of Witchcraft, our pious Author names <hi>Judiciary Aſtrology, as it is commonly practiced, whether for the caſting of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivities, or prediction of voluntary, or civil Events, or the diſcovery of things ſtollen or loſt: The natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Aſtrology</hi> (he ſays) <hi>when it keeps it ſelf within its due bounds, is lawful and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, (although not without much uncertainty of iſſue;) But that other Calculatory, or Figure-caſting Aſtrology is preſumtuous and unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; cried ever down by Concils and Fathers, as unlawful; as that which lies in the midway be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:101289:136"/>
Magick and Impoſture, and partakes not a little of both.</hi> Now here lies the main pinch, that ſo Learned, ſo Reverend, ſo Pious, and ſo great a Father ſeems to think ſo hardly of our Aſtrological skill: but it is but a meer <hi>ſeem ſo,</hi> and no really ſuch hard thought of, as at firſt ſight it may ſeem to be.</p>
                  <p>For Firſt, The <hi>natural Aſtrology, when it keeps it ſelf within its due bounds,</hi> he very heartily al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows us <hi>lawful and commendable.</hi> And it is <hi>no other Aſtrology</hi> that we plead for as lawful. For no farther deſire we our <hi>Arts Juſtification</hi> then <hi>natural cauſes,</hi> and <hi>due bounds</hi> are ſure to juſtifie it.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>8</label> Secondly, As for that other <hi>Calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory or Figure-caſting Aſtrology,</hi> which he cries down <hi>as preſumtuous and unwarrantable,</hi> it is of two ſorts;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It is no more then ſuch a <hi>Calculation,</hi> as repreſents nothing but a ſcite of the <hi>Heavens,</hi> and the <hi>Stars</hi> and <hi>Planets</hi> therein, with their <hi>Aſpects</hi> to each other, and of all of them upon us here below; and this only in order to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſo much there from them, as conſtant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience hath always verified to be the natural production of ſuch a Figure. A <hi>red Evening</hi> was a common preſage in our Saviour's time, of <hi>a fair Morrow,</hi> and this was to be ſeen without caſting a Figure for it. Now I demand, how came we to know thus much of <hi>natural Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi> but by <hi>conſtant obſervation</hi> and <hi>experience</hi> thereof? And what if the ſame <hi>Obſervation</hi> and <hi>Experience</hi> ſhould take a little more pains, and by more curious and ſtrict examination ſhould find out the grounds of this <hi>red Evening,</hi> how it hangs lodg'd in the Aſpects of the Stars, and their ſeveral occurrences, one among another, and by virtue of theſe inquiries, to be able to
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:101289:136"/>
predict the <hi>red Evening</hi> it ſelf, and not only ſo, but to be able alſo to ſay when it ſhall be <hi>fair,</hi> without a <hi>red Evening,</hi> and not only ſo, but to go farther ſtill, and to be able to predict yet more and more productions of Nature? Will any man be ſo malitiouſly mad, as to ſay the firſt only ſhall be lawful, and the reſt ſinful and wicked, although all come from the very <hi>ſame Obſervation</hi> as the firſt, only as Obſervation grew old, ſo it grew wiſer, and as it came to mans eſtate, attained to underſtand a great deal more then when it was but in its Minority and Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood? For be it ſo, that by looking into the Heavens, it be poſſible for ingenious Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to learn a little, there can be nothing to be doubted, but the more and longer Obſervation, more and more is skill to be learned. And now all that we pretend to for matter of Aſtrological practice, it is no more then after the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as is the Obſervation of the <hi>red Evening,</hi> of which our Saviour gives this Sacred Teſt, that it is a real truth. And thus far therefore is nothing but <hi>natural Aſtrology,</hi> and therefore though <hi>Calculatory and Figure-caſting</hi> in a certain ſence, is <hi>lawful and commendable</hi> by the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our <hi>learned and pious Author,</hi> as well as of our ever <hi>bleſſed Saviour.</hi> But then there is another ſort of <hi>Figuring</hi> and <hi>Calculation,</hi> after the way of <hi>Cornelius Agrippa,</hi> which however under a Cloak, and for pretence may be called, but is no real <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> and this no doubt but is, very <hi>preſumtuous</hi> and <hi>unwarrantable,</hi> as his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip complains. Again alſo, I deny not but ſome there are real <hi>Aſtrologers,</hi> who work by <hi>true Figures</hi> of the <hi>Heavens,</hi> but then they mingle with theſe certain <hi>Magical practices,</hi> whereby they call the <hi>inviſible powers</hi> to aid them in the judgment of that Figure. And this being ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:101289:137"/>
beyond the <hi>bounds of Nature,</hi> with our Reverend Author we alſo do utterly abhor, as ſuch <hi>which was ever cried down by Councils and Fathers as unlawful.</hi>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>9</label> Laſtly, As to what is ſaid, <hi>That which lies in the midway betwixt Magick and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture, and partakes not a little of both.</hi> This now is a plain Character what kind of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrology</hi> it is our Author is diſpleaſed at.</p>
                  <p>For Firſt, As for matter of <hi>Magick,</hi> it is a practice as much different from <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> as it is from <hi>Divinity.</hi> Some <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> its true indeed, cannot contain themſelves within compaſs, but muſt be tampering with black Arts; and there be <hi>Divines</hi> too, who do as much. But as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity is not in the fault, ſo neither is <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, As for matter of <hi>Impoſture,</hi> we know it is too true, that too many in the World who have no skill in <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> or at moſt no more then to draw a Scheme, and to make a prate of it without ſo much as any Arithmetical or Aſtronomical knowledg, without both which, no man can make a true <hi>Aſtrologer,</hi> but however theſe pretenders driving a Trade with their familiars, and uſing many crafty ſleights, can judg of ſtollen goods, and love-matters, and tell ſtrange ſtories, which they have by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay, and pretend they have it by the Stars. But this is nothing to <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> no more then 'tis to <hi>Muſick</hi> or <hi>Geometry.</hi> But however by means of ſuch Cheats as theſe, and many diabolical Tricks fathered upon <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> it comes to paſs many Reverend and wiſe men are hereby drawn into miſunderſtandings, conceiting this Sacred and Heavenly Art to be quite otherwiſe then to what indeed it is. I remember the ſtories of the poor <hi>Heathens in Peru,</hi> who almoſt induced
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:101289:137"/>
to <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> yet refuſed to be Baptized, by means of the vicious lives of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> alledging that the moſt <hi>Bleſſed Heaven</hi> could not be good, where ſuch wicked men pretended to be tranſlated, and therefore they would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chooſe <hi>Hell without Baptiſm,</hi> then go to Heaven in company with ſo evil Livers. Such was the ill luck of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> at that time. And ſuch truly has been the hard Fate of <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi> of late years.</p>
                  <p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>10</label> Now had it been ſo, that this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Father, had utterly diſreliſhed our <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Aſtrology,</hi> as it is plain he did not, yet may we anſwer,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That there are others of as equal Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Learning, and Reverence, who as much have befreinded it.</p>
                  <p>And Secondly, It would have been no ſuch great wonder, conſidering,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, How much the practice of this Science has been neglected in the late <hi>Chriſtian</hi> times. For while we abhorred, and fled from Sorcery and Witchcraft, and burned all Books tending to that purpoſe, it came to paſs that abundance of <hi>Abhorrency</hi> led into a contrary extream to neglect alſo ſuch reading as was both tolerable and commendable.</p>
                  <p>And then Secondly, While the Learned neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected this ſtudy, it came to paſs that none, or few but the vicious taking up the practice, it was ſeldom uſed but with abuſe. And thence hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be the more and the farther hated by the holy wiſe and learned. And no doubt but this Holy man our Author, out of his abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency of the vicious practices of ſome <hi>Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> of his time, might be drawn into the greater diſlike of what himſelf had not ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:101289:138"/>For Thirdly, The moſt Wiſe, and Learned, and Holy, are not competent Judges of what themſelves alſo are not read in. And as for this Science of <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> I humbly ſuppoſe it no blemiſh to our Reverend Father, if we hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſuppoſe he never read ſo much of it, as to well underſtand it: For we do not hold <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi> abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a wiſe man is not bound to ſtudy all things, and as ſo, no more of this then, he would the Art of Dyalling, or Globe-making, or any ſuch like famous ſtudies: But beſides we know all mens Genius does not naturally incline them to ſtudy <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> or at leaſt if they ſhould, yet ſhall they not be any ways aſſured to hit of it. And amongſt men of this contrary Genius, no wonder is it, if here and there ſome are led a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by a natural diſaffection to talk againſt <hi>Aſtrology</hi> with ſomewhat of the extream in their Pens and Lips. But we have to do with a more pious Author, only may he but rightly be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>11</label> Wherefore hear yet on. <hi>Satan</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>beguiles the ſimple upon theſe two miſgrounded Principles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That in all experience they have found ſuch effects following upon the uſe and practice of ſuch means; which indeed cannot be denied: Charms and Spells</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>commonly are no leſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>failing in their working, then the beſt natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, doubtleſs the Devil is a moſt skilful Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, and can do feats beyond all mortal powers; but God bleſs us from imploying him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>That there may be hidden cauſes in Nature for the producing of ſuch effects, which they know not; neither can give any reaſon of their operations; whereof yet we do commonly make uſe, without any ſcruple; and why may not theſe be
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:101289:138"/>
ranged under the ſame head? Which they have uſed with no other but good meaning; without the leaſt intention of reference to any malignant powers. In anſwer whereto, I muſt tell them, that their beſt plea is ignorance; which may abate the ſin, but not excuſe it: But then follows his conceſſion, There are indeed, deep ſecrets in Nature, whoſe bottom we cannot dive into; as thoſe wonders of the Loadſtone; a peice outwardly contemptible, yet of ſuch force as approaches near to a Miracle: And many other ſtrange Sympathies and Antipathies in ſeveral Creatures; in which rank may be ſet the bleeding of the Dead, at the preſence of the Murtherer: and ſome acts done for the diſcovery of Witchcraft both in this and our neighbour Kingdom; but withal, though there be ſecrets in Nature, which we know not how ſhe works; yet we know there are works which are well known, that ſhe cannot do; how far her power can extend, is not hard to determin: and thoſe effects which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond this, (as in the forementioned particulars) we know whither to aſcribe: Let it be therefore the Care and Wiſdom of Chriſtians, to look upon what grounds they go: Whiles they have God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for their warrant, they may walk ſafely; but where theſe leave them the way leads down to the Chambers of Death.</hi>

And true it is, that <hi>diabolical</hi> practices, ſuch as Charms and Spells, want not for experimental aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the truth of their effects, as well as <hi>natural,</hi> by reaſon of the Devils <hi>skilful Arts</hi> to bring them about. But then again, whoſoever has the true and ſaving knowledg of God's Word in his head, and the ſavour of as true Piety in his heart, can very aptly and eaſily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:101289:139"/>
between <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Diabolical</hi> experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And by every of theſe we are ſure that our Aſtrological experiments are ſafe enough from any kind of Diabolical help.</p>
                  <p>But as for the Second <hi>misbranded Principle,</hi> undoubtedly it is a very great truth, That <hi>there are hidden cauſes in Nature for the producing of ſuch effects which we know not, nor can give a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their operation, which yet we do,</hi> and doubt not but we may lawfully <hi>make uſe of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any the leaſt ſcruple.</hi> And under <hi>this ſame head,</hi> although there, is great reaſon why all thoſe charming practiſing by the Holy Father reckoned up, ſhall not be <hi>ranged,</hi> yet is there as much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why our <hi>Aſtrological practices</hi> ſhould be ſo <hi>ranged under this head,</hi> and perhaps ſome few others which I have excepted from the reſt. Now this <hi>Holy Father</hi> to diſtinguiſh himſelf between an holy care to defend and keep harmleſs, and well meaning people from the ſnares of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and an heady and violent envy at any doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful practices does grant, That <hi>there are indeed deep ſecrets in Nature, whoſe bottom we cannot dive into, as thoſe wonders of the Loadſtone</hi> for one, <hi>whoſe force approacheth near to a Miracle.</hi> Now ſuch an ingenious and ſerious Monitor we have much more reaſon to reſpect, then a raſh Freind. For does not reaſon teach us, that would we ſtreighten a crooked ſtick, it muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be bent ſomwhat the contrary way? And ſo to avoid the wiles of the Devil, we do acknowledg it no fault, if a man rather then fail do a little enter caution againſt lawful things. And the truth is, where a man is not fenced with the more grace, it is good council to him to avoid many ſtudies in themſelves lawful, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then endanger himſelf within compaſs of Diabolical ſnares. And I am confident that this

is the very utmoſt that ever this Holy Father in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended againſt <hi>Aſtrology.</hi> For do but obſerve, how he diſtinguiſheth himſelf. <hi>Though there be ſuch ſecrets in Nature, which we know not how ſhe works, yet we know there are works which are well known, that ſhe cannot do.</hi> But this cannot be applied unto <hi>our natural Aſtrology,</hi> whoſe works we have good aſſurance of, that they are perfectly natural. <hi>How far her power can extend</hi> (he ſays) <hi>is not hard to determin, and thoſe works which are beyond this, we know whether to aſcribe, that is to the Devil,</hi> and ſo ſay we. But then refers he to the <hi>forementioned particulars,</hi> of all which he delivers his holy and cautionary thoughts to beware, and ſo ſay we too. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt theſe indeed is <hi>Aſtrology</hi> in the range; but then firſt, it is not without a diſtinction of the lawful and unlawful <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> and ſome other things, he reckons in the number too, no doubt, not ſo much out of certain knowledg of their abſolute unwarrantableneſs, as out of abundance of caution, which being things of a doubtful warrant, it is better to beware and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain, then to venture upon the uncertainty. For ſo he concludes, <hi>Let it be therefore the care and wiſdom of Chriſtians to look upon what grounds they go: whiles they have God and Nature for their warrant, they may walk ſafely.</hi> And no longer let me ſtudy <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> then thoſe go along with me. For as he concludes, <hi>where they leave us,</hi> or any one elſe, <hi>the way leads down to the Chambers of Death.</hi> And thus our hearty thanks, and reverent reſpects, to this Learned and Holy Father, for his moſt ſavory, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Councel. I alſo conclude, That <hi>Aſtrology</hi> being a ſtudy exceedingly converſant in the deep ſecrets and wonders of Nature, where every action of the Heavens is equal to the Miracle of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:101289:140"/>
Loadſtone. So let me ſtudy and practice it, as the more I behold God's wonders in Nature thereby, the more may I glorifie my Maker, by beholding the more of his great Glory in all his wondrous works. And while I ſtudy thus, I find that next under Theology, nothing leads me more near unto this ſight of God, then this Sacred Aſtrological ſtudy of the great works of Nature.</p>
